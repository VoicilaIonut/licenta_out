*Despite intensive research on educational curricula and educational strategies dealing with the issue of the efficient availability and use of educational techniques in secondary schools, but we can only find vivid examples of these techniques and their efficiency in a very limited research papers providing that , to be applied and used as a model for other schools. This study was conducted in Romania and Iraq. Where we only focused on those educational techniques which we have chosen to strengthen and regu late the educational process in educational institutions, where parents are now more inclined to encourage the use the educational techniques in the education of students (their children), where they recently started to believe that such technologies promo te learning for students, and students are also more inclined to use educational technologies in classrooms, and teachers also see that these educational techniques facilitate the process of education, as it reduces the extra effort on their shoulders and reduce the time wasted in the classrooms, so the related* 

*authorities in the Ministry of Education started to adopt the point of view of intensifying the task of providing these educational technologies and physical facilities to end the current educational crisis in secondary schools, so that the teaching staffs will use them in an easily and flexible way, and all of the three parts of the educational process triangle parents, teachers and students must collaborate with each other facilitate the use of thes e techniques and keep them in order to achieve effective and more active education.*

## **CURRICULUM AND EDUCATIONAL STRATEGIES FOR EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY COMPETENCY. COMPARISON STUDY BETWEEN THE IRAQ AND ROMANIA**

## <span id="page-10-0"></span>**Introduction**

Recently there has been a tendency to study the immense gap between the educationally students' needs and the professional teachers' capacity in order to maintain the rapid of cultural changes. There is an increasingly necessity need to recruit many of the tools and techniques of educational modern strategies, to achieve the development of students ' skills in thinking and research, criticism, listening and discipline, to the maximum extent possible. In order to accomplish the stage of studies; for teachers' skills ought to increase his knowledge in all areas of education, and trends related to evaluate the depth of study of the students and to see the finest ways to reach their minds and hearts. The educational process has become, in our time, a human long-term project that needs to increase the interest in science and research and internal creativity of the student, also to increase motivation and desire to achieve. However, the educational trend in many of the existing educational institutions, still depends on the means and methods of indoctrination characteristic to traditional education, which reduce the student's will and involvement, waiting for his turn always to participate, at a time determined by the teacher, and in accordance with what he sees. This may lead to the suppression of his talents, and turn off the creative flame that she/he has.

Educational technology is a symbol of the progress of science and technology of this age, which is invaded modern life and vast circle of the users. Education technology has become one of the most important methods that can effectively use for preparing and organizing the fundamental technical elements (studies and materials) of the study, it can be used to achieve the educational goals based on scientific and technical progress.

It has become a necessity to expand and diversify the educational strategies and the use of Education technologies in education, in order to achieve many of the educational goals.

Hence the aim of this research is to scientifically illuminate on some of the important skills in the teaching profession, instructional strategies, the use of information technology and the methods to use it as an educational tool for effective and efficient adjuvant for the student in thinking, learning and an aid for progress on all levels, intellectual and social.

## **Study's problem and its questions**

One of the most important means which must be activated by the Ministry of Education in all states of the world is the technical activation in education in order to obtain the aim of the goals and to improve the educational process of learning, which will reflect positively on the educational outcomes, and from here this study will examine the degree of availability of teaching techniques and the degree of usage of teaching techniques the role of curriculum and educational strategies for the development of the use of Education technology in the educational process and making an appropriate recommendations in order to improve its use.

## **Study's questions**

 The study aims to examine the degree of availability of teaching techniques and the degree of usage of teaching techniques at secondary schools in Iraq and Romania and the role of curriculum and educational strategies in the development the use of some technologies for "Educational Technology" in the educational process, and making the appropriate recommendations to improve its use, by answering the following questions:

The first question: What is the degree of availability of teaching techniques at the secondary schools in Iraq and Romania?

Second question: What is the degree of usage of teaching techniques at secondary schools in Iraq and Romania?

Third question: What is the role of curricula in the development of efficient use of Educational technologies in education?

Fourth question: What is the role of educational strategies in the development of efficient use of Educational technologies in education?

Fifth question: Are there any significant differences regarding the teachers' use of information technology due to the variables of sex, experience and qualifications?

Sixth question: What are the obstructions faced by the use of educational technologies and study aids at secondary schools in Iraq and Romania?

## **Study's objectives**

 This study aims to examine the role of curriculum and instructional strategies for the development of the use of Educational technology technologies in the educational process, and the relationship with some variables such as sex, experience, and qualifications, according to the following objectives:

(1) Examine the role of curriculum in the development of an efficient use of information technology in education techniques.

(2) To find out the role of instructional strategies in the development of efficient use of information technology in education techniques.

# <span id="page-14-0"></span>**Chapter I: Educational Curricula in the Schools. The Foundations**

## <span id="page-14-1"></span>**1. History of the Curriculum and Importance of the Curriculum**

"With its importance in formal education, the curriculum has become a dynamic process due to the changes that occur in our society. Therefore, in its broadest sense, curriculum refers to the total learning experiences of individuals not only in school but society as well." (Bonifaz, 2010)

Barrett et al stated that "a good curriculum must satisfy three criteria: it must be effective in helping students learn more rapidly than they would on their own; what students learn should benefit both the individual and society as a whole; and it must employ positive rather than coercive or positive methods." Curriculum is contributed to develop "thinking skills and the acquisition" to relevant knowledge that students require to apply in their studies, daily life and careers. (Barrett et al,2001)

Due to the fast and progressive growth in all aspects of knowledge, there was a need to review and enhance curriculum, and due to this fact, students are most likely to lose a very important part of knowledge that is restored in curriculum.

The term "curriculum" comes from the latin word *currere*, which in English can be translated as "running" and it was first used in Scotland, in 1820, and a century later in the US. Over time, the initial term "currere" developed new meanings, such as school course or scholar itinerary.

After 1920, the curriculum-ul became a field of systematic preoccupation in pedagogy and the concept included all the experiences that the student has in school. (Kearney and Cook, 1960). The first entry of the term in The Oxford English Dictionary (OED), was describing the curriculum as "a compulsory study or training in a school or university" (Creţu, 1998, p.103).

Restrictively, until the first half of the 19th century, the concept of curriculum was overlapping with the one of learning content. Broadly, as a modern perspective, curriculum represents an integrative concept, approached globally and systemically, regarding its components and interactions.

At the middle of the 20th century, the concept included methodology, objectives and evaluation, besides content. The concept extended on the plan of relating to the forms of formal education (UNESCO), and on the plan of relating to the forms of informal education, who put a greater emphasis on practice, rather than the theoretical aspect.

From a historical perspective, the curriculum can be defined as a dynamic concept, which undertook various growth and constant enrichments. In 1950, the theory of curriculum started to develop more intensively. Nowadays, the theory of curriculum is a pedagogical discipline which studies the content of education and the methods employed for selecting its contents which must value all element of human knowledge from science, technique, art, morals, religion, sports, and others which are considered relevant for the training process of the student and for the development of the human personality. In essence, the curriculum is a project which has the value of and educational action (Potolea, 2002).

The European dimension emerged in the language of educational policies in the late 1980s and refers to mutual learning efforts, joint exchanges and projects carried out by educational establishments in EU countries. The European dimension is a final community of all educational systems in Europe, marked by human rights, pluralism and the rule of law (Potolea et al, 2008).

## <span id="page-15-0"></span>**2. Curriculum: concept and development**

The curriculum has two concepts:

#### **2.1: The old curriculum concept**

This method is known by this concept as having many different definitions, all of them converging to the following meaning:

- (1) Group of study disciplines or various terms studied by the students.
- (2) Group of courses or study disciplines where the student must pass or get good grades in the main field from the two main ones, like mathematics or the social disciplines
- (3) The general and complete plan of the disciplines that should be studied by the student in the school for getting a study certificate (a diploma) that qualifies him to work in a certain profession or craft.
- (4) Group of studies or services acquired by the student at the guidance of the school or of the college.

It should be noted also that these definitions have to meet the following points:

#### **Main points:**

- (1) The attention paid to the discipline or to the study disciplines while the student is studying individually, without a teacher or while being taught in the classroom or by other means, without showing that the student has to be forced to study certain knowledge in order to succeed.
- (2) The attention paid to the quantity of the knowledge, for the student to benefit from "a collection of materials and courses", whereas many disciplines are often crowded and disjoined, having no connection between each other.
- (3) Considering that the examination is passed and obtaining the diploma according to the curricula, whereas the student has an interest for the classes and for their utilitarian value that benefits himself and the community.
- (4) There is no interest in the physical aspects and psychological aspects of the pupil or for his skills, whereas the qualification for the work profession or for the craft is only related to the educational achievements.

The assumption of equality between pupils and expecting to reach the right level of the achievements, without taking into consideration the individual differences. The reason for all of this is the old perception of knowledge, it was the general belief that knowledge is the supreme good and that increasing the knowledge of the individual increases his virtues; because knowledge itself leads to a behavior change and generates the gain of different involuntary human skills. Many received the information according to their understanding, which was enough just for training their minds and developing their intelligence, afterwards reaching a personal phrasing that is shown in the society (Shehata, 1998).

#### **2.2. The new curriculum concept**

 The modern concept of the curriculum: the curriculum changed, at the same time with the development and progress of science and research, especially for those which emphasized the need to adapt the curriculum for learners instead of preexisting conditioning given to students. The curriculum has been defined by the modern concept also by the use of several definitions, including the following:

A set of regular activities: the content, the tools, the teaching aids, provided under the supervision of the school, preparing students for an effective learning and for a good life. A variety of experiences that are formed, which are created in order to allow the learner to pass.

The range of guided experiences adopted by the community leaders as they will be achieved, ending in benefitting the emerging growth and success of personal and social planning, under the supervision of the school (Hindi et al., 2008). All the experiences planned "inside and outside the school, in order to achieve the overall growth of the learner in all aspects of his personality, including the achievement of his objectives and building a proper behavior, as well as modifying the unwanted behavior so that he will be a good citizen." (Al-Shibli, 2000).

Total diverse expertise offered by the school to students inside and outside the school, in order for them to achieve an integrated development in the building of human beings, according to specific educational goals and according to the scientific plans drawn, physically, mentally, psychologically, socially and religiously (Shehata ,1998).

The concept exceeds the knowledge taught and it deals with all the ingredients that work together to formulate an educational output and print a special character, achieving an involuntary personal decency which must be integrated, including the spiritual, mental, physical and social aspects. It features a modern concept of curriculum that:

#### **Main point:**

- (1) Is not limited to the texts and information of the textbook content alone, but rather deal with it as a component of the curriculum components and a means for its implementation.
- (2) The implementation of the curriculum is no longer restricted to the activity that is within the school, but also to all extra-curricular activities that take place outside the school.
- (3) The main concern is not only forming the student's mind, but also seeking to achieve the overall growth of his personality, in all aspects.
- (4) The care is focused on building a passive behavior of the learner rather than charging his mind and theory of knowledge, regardless of his values and instinct.
- (5) There is comprehensive care granted to the planning of integrated educational experiences that help the learner to learn and to build a proper behavior.
- (6) There is an interest in setting clearly the educational goals and the different levels and working the way up to achieve them.
- (7) Care is given to the actual yield of the educational process of the individuals and of the community as a whole. (Al-Shibli, 2000).

## <span id="page-18-0"></span>**3. The foundations of the curriculum**

The foundations intended for the rules based on which the curriculum was created, served as the origins and roots where the entire tree started its branches. Also, the intended foundations of intellectual theories and theoretical beliefs owed by the elaborators of the curriculum involved setting the curriculum off, building it and implementing it. Thus, every human activity was made based upon the doctrine emerging from these roots and built upon them. The economic euphoria which emerged when factories and state owned companies were established, which were working together behind a particular economic theory, guided this destinations or the others, as well as the social, medical and political activity and other activities carried out by the State or by individuals. Thus, the theoretical thinking, which could be behind any activity carried, includes all the elements and internal parties in that activity.

The approach is built on a group of foundations and by several specialists in the field of curriculum planning, classifying those foundations in four types:

- Basis of the knowledge.
- Philosophical foundations.
- Psychological foundations.
- Social foundations.

Cognitive foundations have been incorporated with the philosophy, as culture was individualized as a special dimension, with independent foundations (Ryan, 1999).

## <span id="page-19-0"></span>**4. Factors Influencing the Construction of Educational Curricula**

The evolution of human life and the knowledge of platforms in general, especially during this time, when the means of communication and the human evolution evolving negatively and becoming knowledge, increasing then the educational curricula affected by it for the nature of the curriculum to keep pace with the global and regional developments, whereas these factors are the following:

(1) The philosophical factor: philosophy does not mean human knowledge per se, as much as the use of the knowledge guided them to walk in one lifestyle without the other, and that each community philosophy is not written necessarily, being explained but existing as long as heritage exists. The usefulness of the philosophy considers that the ideas of that society, its culture and sources of education, as well as its places on the second place and with the actual application of the practical effort.

(2) The historical factor: it is the result of continuous interaction between elements of different cultures in multiple communities over long historical periods, and leave the date mark on education just as various elements of life and cultures are within a community, whereas we can say that the existence of historical depth in the educational process helps the process of education in the knowledge upon:

- a) What the nation inherited from the past and what I have prepared for the present, as well as how to plan the future.
- b) What is encountered in various educational problems, in the light of the old problems addressed similarly;
- c) The moving away from "what is not in favor of the nation and the search for what is useful" (Ibrahim, 1983, p. 35).

 (3) The psychological factor: it is a scientific research in education and the results of psychological science and human knowledge, breathing the old theories and correcting errors in process of teaching and learning. Such a concept of relying on mental training, he discovered his mistake in the last moment, at the time to enlighten on the developments to the field of education. Psychological factors shall underlie education as the following:

- a) Knowledge upon the nature of learning: learning theories, choosing the right theme for each of the learning topics.
- b) Knowing the nature of the learner: in terms of needs, composition, abilities, inclinations and behavior.

(4) The social factor: the environment is that set by the man, used for the idea of the mind and for managing the work and legacy.

At the examination of the social factors, one must know the structural dimensions of communities in terms of physical construction and he must guide them towards the external influences of natural environment, such as climate and terrain and natural resources, as well as population structure, being also guided towards the sex of the population, its religion, origins, gender, age and composition. Also, the construction of the profession means that there are certain industries and professions, as well as the construction of the class, including the caste system in society and social levels.

There is also, the building of the prevailing administrative and institutional regulations of the profession, in the rural and urban areas and in the system of formal and informal schools.(Ibid., Page 28

(5) The political factor: since there was a system called a state or government system that became the policy of the organization, having an important role in the life of the community, and affected by that education (Ibrahim, 1983).

(6) The economical factor: the economic theory, going by the community, is determined by the conduct of that community and by its ways of life, thus rising generations, whether this economic system is based on agriculture or depends on commerce and industry.

The relationship between the economy and education is a close relationship, the higher the economic level and the increased national income, the development of education quality and quantity.

(7)The religious factor: religion is a belief, or ideas dominate the thinking of individuals and groups collecting and organizing their living styles and their interactions with each other, so that religion remains a way of life and an explanation of the phenomena, thus becoming an educational goal.

(8)The cultural factor: according to the word "culture" in that part of the environment that man has acquired and used for manufacturing, culture represents his ideas and ideals, knowledge, beliefs, skills and habits and other elements that fall under the theme of culture and the role of education, coming for the preservation of cultural heritage, so as to unite individuals and guide their behaviors and ideas (Ibrahim, 1983).

## <span id="page-21-0"></span>**5. Components of the curriculum**

#### **5.1. Goals**

Objectives vary depending on cognitive, emotional and skill related objectives and also depending on a variety of sources; it derives from the nature of the learner, the culture of the community, the environment, the goals of state, the academics, the specialists in the subject, and teachers' suggestions. Each of these parts must be involved in setting targets at the planning of the curriculum. The targets in general are guided towards the behavior events expected from the students after the completion of the content delivery in each specific class or at the end of the curriculum.

The definition of educational goals:

#### **Intended educational general objectives: (goals) are**

- Changes that are expected to happen in the curriculum of the pupils' personalities.
- In other considerations: the cognitive behavioral changes expected at the events caused by pupils' personalities, as a result passing from their interaction with the educational teaching experience position.
- In other words: "the cognitive, emotional and skill changes of the learner as a result of the passing-oriented educational experiences, and the reflection of these changes on his behavior and performance "(Atta, 1992, p.101-102).
- Or this is an exact description of the required forms of change set in the student's behavior, after passing a certain educational experience. In other words, this is: the delivery of what we mean by drafting the variables required by the learner, describing the formulation, showing what it would be like when the learner must have completed successfully the learning experience "It's a description of the pattern of behavior, or performance that we could estimate for the learner's statement."(Toema, 1981, p.63). The occurrence of the change due to attain useful information and developing skills of emotions.

#### **Goals of the curriculum and Questions**

The curriculum is the tool used in order to achieve educational goals, as it has been shown in the first section of the first chapter, whereas the concept is no longer limited to the knowledge-based content that empties the minds of learners through the material or the combination of materials, but becoming multiple items. What are those elements?

In 1949, the educational communication (Ralph Tyler) to ask a series of questions feeling that the answer determines the elements in the form of modern approach and its conception through these inquires:

(1) What are the educational goals should be the ones that the school is trying to achieve?

(2) What experiments should be saved and what goals can be achieved?

(3) In what way should such educational innovations could be comprised and submitted efficiently?

(4) How to judge, when these targets have already been achieved?

#### **Basic Answers**

Based on these questions and answers about the expected, the four elements of the curriculum identified are the following:

(1) Objectives that the school seeks to achieve and sources at (Taler) are: education, contemporary life, art experts, and the philosophy of community psychology.

- (2) The content (experiences)
- (3) Organizing the experiences.
- (4) The calendar

This is limited to the cognitive aspect according to the traditional concept of curriculum. Content is defined definition of the most comprehensive that: the total educational experiences, facts, information, which please provide students with them, as well as the attitudes and values that are meant for them, and finally the motor skills that are meant to be acquired by them in order to achieve an integrated overall growth for them in the light of the planned curriculum goals (Toema, 1981). "The educational experience or education is intended to entrepreneur education that lays the vision of how to determine its contents, and much of its potential, educational materials or activities carried out by the students. Position may be in the classroom or outside it may be out of school" (Allagany and Ali, 1999, p.127).

Educational experiences to be teaching them to students in an educational position in accordance with the educational standards, and it must be relevant to students' lives, check the demands of growth, taking into account the needs of society and the conditions of the environment, and its expertise in the books and courses and direct experience (conduct live experiments) and various reference such as newspapers, magazines, brochures, and all what helps to develop self-learning so that the textbook is not the only source of knowledge (Negreț, 2008).

Curriculum content is a central point where all the elements come together in a circular relationship it affects and is affected by each element. When building approach one must answer another two basic questions:

(1) What is the nature content embodied in the curriculum? In other words what a school offers to students?

(2) How is the content regulated? Which is the image that presents the content to the students?

## <span id="page-24-0"></span>**6. Competency-based curriculum. Key competency in Romania and E.U.**

"A curriculum that emphasizes the complex outcomes of a learning process (i.e. knowledge, skills and attitudes to be applied by learners) rather than mainly focusing on what learners are expected to learn about in terms of traditionally-defined subject content. In principle such a curriculum is learner-centered and adaptive to the changing needs of students, teachers and society. It implies that learning activities and environments are chosen so that learners can acquire and apply the knowledge, skills and attitudes to situations they encounter in everyday life. Competency-based curricula are usually designed around a set of key competences/competencies that can be cross-curricular and/or subject-bound." (Unicef, 2009)

The key competences have an explicit and implicit presence clearly specified in the National Education Law, which shows that their inclusion represents the maximum referential of the educational process finality.

Article 4 of the LEN states that: "The main purpose of education is the formation of competences to define as "a multifunctional and transferable set of knowledge, skills and attitudes that all individuals need for personal fulfilment and development, inclusion and developments." (Canado, 2013)

In art. 13 Underlines that lifelong learning is a guaranteed right; this key competence thus becomes a major educational target.

Article 31 (6) shows the role of the "non-formal or informal" component in the formation of competences in high school education.

Art. 68 - (1) "the national curriculum for primary and secondary education focuses on 8 key competencies that determine the student's training profile:

a) Romanians' Communicative competency and their native language, when it comes to the minorities.

#### National;

b) Communication skills in foreign languages;

c) Basic skills in mathematics, science and technology;

d) Digital competences for the use of information technology as a learning tool;

Knowledge;

- e) Social and civic competences;
- f) Entrepreneurial skills;
- g) Awareness and cultural expression skills;

h) Competence to learn to learn." (ESTONIA, 2008)

Article 68 (5) emphasizes the idea that education in high schools is central to develop and diversify the key competences and formation of specific competences which depends on a several elements (profile, specialization or qualification). Article 70 (2) specifies that the virtual school book store and the platform of its e-learning may include another program, examples of lessons, guides, examples of evidence, represent a key competency of the TSI. Article 72 specifies that the assessment is based on competencies. Article 328 (1, 2, 3) includes the definition of lifelong learning, and Article 329 emphasizes that "lifelong learning focuses on the formation and development of key competences and competencies specific to a field of activity or qualification." Key competencies have been present in all previous law versions, starting with the presidential commission (2008), the Education Code (2009), and the variants from the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, until the last form completed by MECTS in 2010. Of course, there were shades in the formulation of these skills, from one variant to another.

#### **Elements of key competencies: Learning outcomes and reference**

In pedagogical literature, competences are interpreted as learning outcomes, in opposition to educational objectives (considered inputs). These competences are structured assemblies of knowledge, skills and values. It is appreciated that there can be no equivalence between competency formulations and different types of expression of objectives. They cannot be reduced or assimilated to each other. Competence is the student's ability to solve a particular situation based on previously acquired skills and knowledge. There is also the opinion that components of a particular competence (or "sub-competence") cannot be described, but some levels of achievement can be approximated.

There is an appreciation that skills can be transformed into "learning situations" (or "learning activities") that are associated with them rather than objectives, regardless of their degree of generality.

Discussion becomes more complex when it comes to verifying or evaluating competence.

The works that refer to the assessment of competences show a certain diversity of approaches and solutions, as well as the absence, for the time being, unitary.

It follows that future developments bring a new reference system.

From the definition of key competence and the analysis of their specifics, the following results are achieved:

- Skills are defined through a system of knowledge skills / abilities attitudes;
- have a transdisciplinary implicit character;
- Key competencies are somehow the educational endings of education compulsory;
- These must be the basis of permanent education

**Table** *1Comparative synthesis of skill options*

Adapted from (DESECO, 2002).

In relation to the key competences system of the European Commission presented so far, there are different nuances in different countries. It is noteworthy that in these approaches mentioned above, new elements arise, especially regarding autonomy, personal initiative, life and career management, which would highlight an area with a specificity resulting from the valorization of the individual possibilities of personal development and development lifetime. The existence of an axiological competence emphasizes the building of value discernment in the appreciation of social activities, products and facts (Birzea, 2010)

## <span id="page-27-0"></span>**7. The Objectives of General Curriculum; the Importance; the Types; the Classification of Educational Objectives of the Curriculum**

The objectives, due to nature or due to extent of the time during which they are achieved, are divided into two sections:

#### *7.1. Educational aims*

These are the considerations describing the expected life of the byproducts on the values' scheme prior to its legal form of educational philosophy prevailing in society. They are also characterized by great generality, but to a lesser degree of purposes because they represent the values believed in by some communities, for a specific educational program, although not directly linked to the school productions, or to classroom productions, a goal specifically achieved on the long term. Examples of these objectives:

a. "Educating young people on civic responsibility and social responsibility".

b. "Educating young people to actively participate in the daily life" (Toema, 1981, p.48)

#### *7.2. Educational purposes:*

They represent the desired results in their investigations from an educational perspective and they are characterized by comprehensiveness and abstraction, because they are not built on advanced planning (Saada, 2005, p.47) given the dreams and hopes of the communities, related to purposes that can be achieved at different levels, which can be represented as follows:

- a. Preparation of a good citizen and of a good man.
- b. The provision of world peace and stability.
- c. Human cooperation to serve humanity as a whole.

#### *7.3. The general educational goals*

They are the purposes used as means between educational goals and learning objectives (instructional objectives), they are the overall objectives of developing a curriculum at a certain stage, such as:

(1) The reflective thinking of the learner's development.

(2) The development of the learner's creativity.

(3) The understanding of the sciences and his numerous applications related to pupils.

(4) Providing professional competence for younger generations of teachers (Saada, 2005).

#### *7.4. Educational goals (instructional objectives)*

They are the objectives related to an article or a group of articles, directly related to school productions or classroom productions (Classroom outcomes), being easily observed and divided into the following:

(1) The near-term goals can be achieved after the lesson called tactical objectives.

(2) Long-term goals achieved at the end of the program or of the specific article called Strategies.

#### **The importance of the objectives**

Clear specific objectives represent sound grounds for all meaningful human activity, therefore activity of interest for educators who are employees in the field of curriculum, including its aspects, planning, drafting and the selection of its method, or of the ways and means of teaching, along with the content and the methods of evaluation.

Moreover, the clarity of the objectives facilitates the teaching and the learning process, because both the teacher and the learner know what it is expected from them and that expectations are not achieved. Derivation has intended sources, goals and assets that derive from their objectives of reference, namely:

(1) The needs and demands of individuals: They are inclinations and desires of individual students and their needs.

(2) The needs of the community: include all the needs of the community including the natural resources and the moral values prevailing in that environment.

(3) The nature of human knowledge: they include all human knowledge in the world, past and present, and all those sources associated with building the foundations of the curriculum, which passed mentioning.

#### **The classification of educational objectives**

The education goals, whether aimed at building values, or at social organization, or at determining social roles that must be exercised by learners at the end of the curriculum, and the classification of many rankings, whereas this is the most common Taxonomy of Bloom.

The first: Class Bloom and goals are divided into three major areas:

- The cognitive domain (cognitive or mental) includes objectives that relate to the knowledge and mental abilities and skills.
- The emotional sphere (emotional or emotional) and the development of feelings of the learner and development, and the development of its doctrines and methods to adapt with people, dealing with the objectives of things in this area related to the degree of acceptance of the individual or reject a particular thing, as describing the types of behavior characterized by a degree of stability as guidance and values orientation and appreciation.
- Kinesthetic area psychology, belong to the goals that relate to automated and manual skills such as speech, swimming, printing and painting ... of performance types that require neuropsychologist motor coordination (Allagany, 1995).

Second: the domain partition to levels similar to incorporate the learner to acquire information, values or skills as follows:

- The cognitive domain is divided into six levels arranged in ascending order:
	- a. A reminder
	- b. Understanding
	- c. Application
	- d. Analysis
	- e. Installation
	- f. Calendar
- The emotional sphere, and rating the learner to five levels also:
- a. Attention to the value (reception)
- b. Receptivity and responsiveness of value
- c. Interest or value cherished

d. Formation of the direction with the gradual tendency towards the implementation.

e. Represents the value and believe in it (Formation of the system of values)

- Skill area (kinesthetic psychology) also rating the learner to the following levels:
	- a. Note skill performance.
	- b. The tradition of skill.
	- c. Exercising the skill of training without direct supervision.
	- d. Practice the skill of (Formation of habits)
	- e. Mastery and marks of the mechanism and ease of performance.
	- f. The skill of creativity in innovative additions to its performance.

These steps express many expressions such as: tradition - communion - Audit - Coordination - normalization - reflected movements - Basic movements - estimated sensorimotor (physical ability) - skilled movements - kinetic expression innovative (Rushdi, 1984).

When formulating objectives one must consider the following:

- Ensure comprehensiveness and coverage of these three areas in an acceptable balance.
- Ensure the comprehensiveness and coverage of the different levels of the field, in the balance, taking into account the level of the student.

It does not mean that previous classification of the areas that the levels take into account in a logical sequence, descending or ascending, The areas may interfere with, the important thing is to ensure availability, not arranged, there is no absolute link between them and the separation of absolute growth, which does not go on the road parallel; it may be the individual's side sentimental, such as love of Arabic as the language of the Koran, does not have a side of a knowledge which might even available to him The emotional and skill in the Qur'an followed subtly without having his cognitive side.

## <span id="page-32-0"></span>**8. Criteria for selection of content**

There are several criteria for selecting curriculum content is divided by some researchers to the basic standards and other complementary, which is a relative issue where views differ, what he considers some of them may be deemed complementary to some other fundamental, and the most prominent of these criteria are:

C.1. Objectivity: and realized that the content is linked to the objectives that have been identified before.

C.2. Honesty is the true content when you have a realistic and authentic and scientifically correct, in line with objectives. Some educators and divides honesty to the type's values:

- a. Scientific honesty: checks and the fact that the concepts and theories that it contains is correct and current content, and essential for the same substance, and is applicable to a wide variety of areas and parking.
- b. Gratified representation: and intended to include the content on the broad themes in multiple areas: facts, events, and personalities ... etc. covering different aspects of objectives.
- c. Psychological truth: the sense that the content is appropriate for learners.
- d. Social honesty: the sense that the content is expressed needs of the community.

C.3. The importance and significance: The content of importance when what is of value in the life of a student with a cover different aspects of the fields of knowledge, and values are interested in mentally development skills and methods of the organization of knowledge and make it available to the learner, and the development trends it. The significance relates to two things:

- a. The importance of content for the field of knowledge: Information and concepts that have wide applications and helps to organize the facts, diagnose problems, interpret, and predict and resolve them in a scientific way.
- b. The importance of content and value for the learner and the community.

C.4. the ability to learn: to observe and be mental capacity, and individual differences, with a commitment to the principles of - tendencies and interests: The content should be consistent with the interests of students and their orientation (Iucu, 2008).

C.5. Gradient in the presentation of educational material.

C.6. Global: content is good at what includes patterns of learning does not recognize geographical boundaries between humans, it is estimated that reflects the content in local version of the community should be the student connects the world around him.

C.7. Social relevance and compatibility

C.8. Take into account the student's age and ability level and the level of material.

C.9. that the experience be directly whenever possible.

C.10. Integrated experiences.

C.11. The experiences are preparing the learner for life, and adapt their behavior to be more socially desirable for the present and the future.

C.12. Focus on the positive, which means that experiences be an optimistic, not a pessimistic character, interesting not boring, not sad joyful, easy to understand is not difficult, in a constructive not destructive.

C.13. Experience that connects theory and practice, science work.

C.14. the varied experience in order to achieve the broad general culture necessary for a modern person (Potolea, 2006).

C.15. Provide an opportunity for the learner to participate in the learning experience (Toema, Ibid., p.66).

## <span id="page-34-0"></span>**9. Organizing the content: Trends, Standards**

There are two trends are used by experts to regulate the content of the curriculum are:

(1) Horizontal organization: It is intended to provide the order of content in the light of the article itself, so that the logical sequence of information into account regardless of the extent to which the some of the learning or the suitability of the capabilities of the students and their orientation, grammatical Topics once taught in a logical sequence: Wholesale nominal and its details, the actual sentence and its details, without heed to its importance for students, history is also arranged in chronological order: pre-Islamic era to modern times. The principles of the gradient from the simple to the complex has been taken into account, it is easy to difficult, but without prejudice to the order (Negreț –Dobridor, 2008).

(2) Psychological regulation: It is intended to provide content in the light of the needs of learners and their own circumstances, not in light of the nature of the material and logical ordering; it provides the actual sentence if the educational situation requires it, what the student wants to learn to satisfy the need is determined by what offers.

Regarding the standards of content regulation, curriculum is based on three criteria proposed by (Ralph Tyler), namely:

#### **Standard**

(1) Continuity: means a vertical relationship; so that they are following the experience supportive of previous experience, concept debutante news addresses again and again in the decisions as during the years of the study, at one stage or in different stages, and be in every show adding new ones. Continuing to ensure the learner paper and breadth of its information department, increasing its depth, and earn the required values and trends, provided that the presentation of the material at a time different from the last time (Cucoș, 2014).

(2) Relay: It means building on previous and subsequent experiences, taking into account the increase in depth.

(3) Integration: It means the horizontal relationship between educational experiences or between the elements of the curriculum; In one article integrated elements: pronunciation is inseparable from teaching listening, teaching as inseparable from teaching texts and rhetoric ... Thus, the substances are integrated, and the elements are also well, this integration helps the pupil to achieve a uniform look consistent, and comprehensive educational experience of linking to each other, provide effort and time, other than as if he studied each item separate and isolated manner (Khatabbia,1997).

Dr. Saleh Al-Hindi also adds his three other complementary criteria to the above, namely:

(1) Accumulation: It is intended to organize educational experiences that are mutually reinforcing in order to occur Tjmaaa or cumulative effect leads to profound changes in the learner.

(2) Balance: It means the balance between the logical organization of the material and psychological organization of learning so that does not depend on one and neglect the other.

(3) Concentration: It is intended to be a center or axis or fulcrum stationed around content and educational experience (Hindi et. al, 2008).

It is noted that the accumulation and balance can be integrated in the concept of integration. There are several ways and methods can be used when selecting curriculum content of which is:

#### **Way and Methods for selection**

(1) Guided by other approaches in the same field, taking into account the different environment and conditions of the programs. (Cucoș, 2014)

(2) The use of the opinions of experts in the field.

(3) Carry out surveys about the characteristics of students and their affiliations and beliefs, needs and aptitudes, and then choose what suits them. (Iucu, 2008)

(4) Analysis: any analysis of the positions that are expected to pass by the student, and appreciation of the content that suits them.

## <span id="page-36-0"></span>**10.The Evaluation; the Importance; the Functions and the Types of the Evaluation**

Popham defines that "evaluation is concerned with gathering data on the dynamics, effectiveness, acceptability, and efficiency of a program to facilitate decision making." (Richards & Lockhart, 1991)The most important target of the assessment process is to find out if the programs of the curriculum are followed in the same way as they were designed to be in the first place. These objectives can be used as a basis for developing more specific descriptions of the intended outcomes of the program.

After establishing the goals, there is a need to determine "how to evaluate the degree of success of each stage of implementation. Evaluation is the determination of the worth of a program, product, procedure or objective, or the potential utility of alternative approaches designed to attain specified objectives." (Warschauer & Matuchniak, 2010)

J. D. Brown defines "evaluation as the systematic collection and analysis of all relevant information necessary to promote the improvement necessary to promote the improvement of the curriculum, and assess its effectiveness and efficiency, as well as the participants' attitudes within the context of the particular institutions involved." (Graves, 1996) There are however, many types of evaluation, the three main ones being formative, summative and diagnostic evaluation "he advantages of formative evaluations, according to Rea-Dickins were clear in that such a process intended to improve the curriculum [and] gather-information from different people over a period of time, as opposed to merely passing an evaluative judgment on the end product of a teaching program (summative evaluation), formative evaluation is designed to provide information that may be used as the basis for future planning and action," (Rea-Dickins and Germaine 1992), while goal-free evaluation, which "attempts to observe and define at what is actually happening in the classroom. In this type of evaluation, goals will be apparent in class if they are relevant...the value of a program resides in the extent to which a program's effects are congruent with the perceived needs of the students." (Unicef, 2009)

However, there is a "place for both types of evaluation in the curriculum renewal process, in the context of this paper the concern is raised by the value of the way in which they are implemented and by their purpose in the first place. Evaluating a curriculum, according to, means being able to determine if the objectives initially assumed, were attained." (Potolea & M, 2006)When evaluating a curriculum, the following aspects must be taken into consideration: the acceptance or rejection of the teachers; the adequacy to the expectancies of the beneficiaries (students, parents, and teachers) and costs.

Scholar lack of successes is something that must take however various factors into consideration. E. Vrăsmas and T. Vrăşmaş (2008) identify three forms of school failure:

- Staying behind - a temporary failure (eg, lower grades than the student's possibilities, the risk of staying up) which consists in showing minor difficulties, adaptation to school requirements that may occur in the life of any student (in this case psycho-pedagogical intervention is recommended);

- Specific failure (specific) - by reference to a certain discipline of study (it is manifested by small notes or coregency); psycho-pedagogical intervention must, in this case, be more complex;

- Generalized failure - repetitive situations of repetition and / or repetition (generated by past phases and by major difficulties, overall and lasting in school adaptation); psycho-pedagogical intervention is very difficult and involves the action of several factors (Vrășmaș et al, 2008).

#### **Importance of the evaluation of schools curriculum**

According to Frank Coffield, evaluation refers to generating and collecting evidence regarding the acquisition of students, and the appreciation of the evidence according to the defined standards. By focusing upon the greater aspects of learning, a person can become an expert in a specified occupational area and can function as an active member of the economy.

Traditionally, the development of competences was not so important within the evaluation of the curriculum, and since it become an important part of the curriculum development, with constant renewal, it should also become an important part of the evaluation. Therefore, curriculum evaluation is used to determine the value of curriculum and to determine whether the curriculum is appropriate. Its importance to take into consideration of the group of students for which it will be used, the selected objects and the recommended materials for instructional purpose.

The purpose of evaluation illustrates its importance for individual progress, for the teacher and especially for the student. The most important purpose of the evaluation can be considered the formal grade system, which represents the evaluation of learning according to national standards of professional competences validated by local committees and which are monitored by the National Institutes that regulate education. The evaluation of the curriculum mainly involves projecting the context of learning and evaluating the projected curriculum (Negreț-Dobridor, 2008).

#### **Functions of the evaluation**

Evaluation is the only way to measure the effectiveness of any educational system, which is permitted for those involved in knowing the strengths to be strengthened, and shortcomings to be addressed (Iucu, 2008). Evaluation has many functions in the educational procedure, and since we now came to have a new modern approach, considering that teaching should bring about more than just academic outcomes, it is a much questioned matter these days. Teachers expect that their teaching should also promote critical thinking, better methods of working, a growth in aspects of personality such as social skills, interests, specific competences, etc

Over the past years, much experimentation has been done with curriculum new approaches, teaching methods and materials, so their functions might have also developed. The main functions of Curriculum evaluation used to be the following:

To set and determine the program's outcomes.

- It helps the program's designer to decide in making his final decision of accepting or rejecting it.
- Bringing out the necessity of the revising process.
- Helping in developing the material in the curriculum assuring its improvement.
- And off course to enhance the teaching methods . (Iucu, 2008).

Evaluation leads many functions, notably:

(1) Assist in judging the value of educational goals; the objectives when formulating serve as hypotheses need to evaluate the process of showing whether they are true or mistake.

(2) Know the extent to which educational goals unwanted.

(3) Diagnosis strengthens and weaknesses in the curriculum or in the collection of the students, so in order to enhance the strengths and weaknesses of the treatment.

(4) Help improve the educational process by determining the level of the progress of students toward educational goals established, and take the necessary decisions to enable them to collect those goals required level.

(5) Enable teachers to discover the effectiveness of educational efforts in bringing about the desired learning outcomes.

(6) Enable learners to see their progress and identify strengths and weaknesses in their performance.

(7) Definition of parents of pupils' extent of their children's progress.

(8) Classification of pupils and promotions in different educational levels and stages.

(9) Facilitate the school administration tasks availability of adequate and accurate information about educational processes / learning of both: quantitative and qualitative.

(10) Predict educational problems and search for solutions.

(11) Curricula and teaching methods evaluation and development.

(12) Gives opportunities for feedback to the student and the teacher, and both contribute to the educational process.

(13) Can the decision makers to take appropriate on general educational development, and curriculum development in particular through providing them with information on the current level of performance and the conditions and facilities for the school's decisions.

The most important function that evaluation has nowadays, in the context of curriculum development, I think is the fact that evaluation can help in bringing changes in the curriculum.

#### **Types of evaluation: models and description and principles**

As mentioned earlier, evaluation is the only way to measure the effectiveness of any educational system, but there are many types of evaluation. Assessment and evaluation studies may take place at the subject, department, or Institutional level, and range in size and scope and it includes a colorful range of technical methods. *Formative evaluation*

Formative evaluation is occurred during curriculum development course and it's designed to contribute to improve the educational program. This type of evaluation occurs during the educational process with the intent or improving performance, often referred to as "feedback." Therefore, "Formative assessment implies that the results will be used in the formation and revision process of an educational effort. Formative assessments are used in the improvement of educational programs." (C, 2008). The means of realization, the formative evaluation can be made through oral examination, as well as self-evaluation tests.

#### *Summative Evaluation*

In summative evaluation is the final effects of a curriculum evaluation in base of the objectives, "this takes place after the curriculum has been fully developed and put into operation. This type of evaluation occurs at the conclusion of an educational activity with the intent of documenting achievement or competence. Summative assessment is used for the purpose of documenting outcomes and judging value. It is used for providing feedback to instructors about the quality of a subject or program." (C, 2008)

The means of realization vary, the summative evaluation consists in written, oral or practical exams, portfolio or project.

 Scriven (1967) was the first who saw "the need to distinguish the formative and summative roles of curriculum evaluation: formative evaluation was intended to foster development and improvement within an ongoing activity (or person, product, program, etc., while summative evaluation, in contrast, was used to assess whether the results of the object being evaluated (program, intervention, person, etc.) met the stated goals." (M, 1967) He preferred the latter type of evaluation, however, to acknowledge Cronbach's merits who sustained that formative evaluation is a device of curriculum development process to be used to improving this course while it was still fluid.

Donald Kirkpatrick proposed an evaluation methodology for judging learning processes, called *Four Level Evaluation Model,* first published in 1994. The model has since been used for other learning processes as well, "such as for the Human Resource Development (HRD) profession, concerned with not only helping to develop formal learning, such as training, but other forms, such as informal learning, development, and education." (Nadler, 1984) The four level evaluation model consists in what Kirkpatrick called "the four steps" (Craig, 1996):

- "Step 1: Reaction How well did the learners like the learning process?
- Step 2: Learning What did they learn? (the extent to which the learners gain knowledge and skills)
- Step 3: Behavior (What changes in job performance resulted from the learning process? (capability to perform the newly learned skills while on the job)
- Step 4: Results What are the tangible results of the learning process in terms of reduced cost, improved quality, increased production, efficiency?" (Kirkpatrick, 1994)

Since the new technology advanced, Kirkpatrick's model has also been improved:

- "Result What impact (outcome or result) will improve our business?
- Performance What do the employees have to perform in order to create the desired impact?
- Learning What knowledge, skills, and resources do they need in order to perform? (courses or classrooms are the LAST answer, see Selecting the Instructional Setting)
- Motivation What do they need to perceive in order to learn and perform? (Do they see a need for the desired performance?)" (Gilbert, 1998)

There is also a third type of evaluation which targets students and is "directed to the placement of students and to discover the deviancies in student learning in a particular field of study." This type of evaluation process is occurred sometime "after an educational activity, with the intent of determining whether the learner has applied the knowledge/skill in practice." From the curriculum development perspective, the principles of curriculum evaluation based on competences are:

- a. To focus on the learning process, rather than the teaching process
- b. To define what students need in terms of knowledge, abilities, and competences.
- c. To define competences or results of the learning that must be attained in terms of performance criteria, expressed in a clear manner that would help the evaluation of students.
- d. Take into consideration the common principles of UE for continuous learning.

Evaluation is also divided in terms of functions and objectives aimed at achieving to:

- Diagnostic Evaluation: aims to detect the problems and difficulties and highlight and identify its causes to help treat them.
- Eclectic calendar: It aims to pick and choose the best inputs, processes education system, and then get better outputs and outcomes of that system.
- Formative assessment (builders) and aims to provide feedback on all elements of education at all stages and steps system, and the statement of strength and vulnerability indicators in each of them, and modify what may exist shortcomings aphid, and builders are overlapped.
- Congregational calendar or final: It aims to issue a final judgment on the outcomes and outputs of the educational process and the extent of quality, such as tracing the graduates of university education in a particular area to see how they benefit from their studies in the process of life, and the appropriateness of the composition of the labor market, and the extent of their success in their jobs. Also benefit this calendar to see how useful a row students study in a substance in the rest of the subjects in a single program, or take advantage of an earlier stage of education in the next stage to them, and this tracking is useful in linking stages of the educational process to each other, and learning educational life linking.
- Therapeutic Evaluation (remedial or corrective) and aims to take the decisions and actions of reform and therapeutic deficiencies or weaknesses or problems and obstacles that might hinder the education system or any of its elements. And treatment essential function for any calendar in the field of education process.

The evaluation can be written, oral or assisted online. If the "evaluation is computer-assisted the principles on which the evaluation process is based are the same: Instruments of assessment; the principles of evaluation; the process of evaluation." (Potolea, 2006).

From the specific context of curriculum evaluation "the earliest curriculum evaluation models, which continue to influence many assessment projects, was that proposed by Ralph Tyler in 1950, in his monograph *Basic Principles of Curriculum and Instruction.* According to Tyler's approach, there are several steps that need to be taken in order to appropriately evaluate the curriculum."(Glatthorn, 1987):

*"Step 1*: Begin with the behavioral objectives that have been previously determined. Those objectives should specify both the content of learning and the student behavior expected."

*"Step* 2. Identify the situations that will give the student the opportunity to express the behaviour embodied in the objective and that evoke or encourage this behavior."

*"Step* 3. Select, modify, or construct suitable evaluation instruments, and check the instruments for objectivity, reliability, and validity."

*"Step* 4. Use the instruments to obtain summarized or appraised results."

*"Step* 5. Compare the results obtained from several instruments before and after given periods in order to estimate the amount of change taking place."

*"Step* 6. Analyze the results in order to determine strengths and weaknesses of the curriculum and to identify possible explanations about the reason for this particular pattern of strengths and weaknesses."

*"Step 7*. Use the results to make the necessary modifications in the curriculum." (Wang & Bryan, 2014)

The Tyler model is systematic and easy to understand and apply. In 1975, Robert "Stake also made a major contribution to curriculum evaluation in his development of the responsive model. According to his approach, an educational evaluation is a responsive evaluation if it orients more directly to program activities than to program intents; responds to audience requirements for information; and if the different value perspectives present are referred to in reporting the success and failure of the program." (Glatthorn, 1987)

Elliot Eisner developed in 1979 his connoisseurship model of evaluation is "built on two *connoisseurship* and criticism. In Eisner's terms, it is important to recognize and appreciate through perceptual memory, drawing from experience to appreciate what is significant. It is the ability both to perceive the particulars of educational life and to understand how those particulars form part of a classroom structure. Criticism, to Eisner, is the art of disclosing qualities of an entity that connoisseurship perceives." (Glatthorn, Curriculum Renewal, 1987)

The main purpose of "curriculum is effective in promoting improved quality of student learning. Student assessment therefore connotes assessment of student learning. Assessment of student learning has always been a powerful influence on how and what teachers teach and is thus an important source of feedback on the appropriateness implementation of curriculum content." (ESTONIA, 2008)

The action regarding the uncommon practices of evaluation are more important for this type of evaluation. Also, this type of evaluation should not be made without someone chosen to be in charge that would help develop abilities for the students and teachers.

## <span id="page-45-0"></span>**11.Conclusions**

To conclude, the curriculum, as a concept, has a wider coverage, designating the meticulous preparation of educational actions, of an entire educational program, with interrelationships between the objectives and modalities of its evaluation. The term curriculum is complex, bringing together many aspects and interactions of teaching components, it can be defined as learning perspective, as desiderative program that prioritizes objectives which must be achieved, from which derives the specific content suited to the method, means, forces, conditions, factors etc. In consequences, a modern curriculum should respect the following:

- Is not limited to the texts and information of the textbook content alone, but rather deal with it as a component of the curriculum components and a means for its implementation.
- The implementation of the curriculum is no longer restricted to the activity that is within the school, but also to all extra-curricular activities that take place outside the school.
- The main concern is not only forming the student's mind, but also seeking to achieve the overall growth of his personality, in all aspects.
- The care is focused on building a passive behavior of the learner rather than charging his mind and theory of knowledge, regardless of his values and instinct.
- There is comprehensive care granted to the planning of integrated educational experiences that help the learner to learn and to build a proper behavior.
- There is an interest in setting clearly the educational goals and the different levels and working the way up to achieve them.
- Care is given to the actual yield of the educational process of the individuals and of the community as a whole (Al-Shibli, 2000).

As educational objectives, content of education, as an aggregate processing information, skills, attitudes, affective feelings, which are derived from the ideal of education and the specific tasks that must be performed by education in order to insert individual in this social present but , especially, to prepare him (for himself, but also for the community). Accordingly, the functions of evaluation are:

- Assist in judging the value of educational goals; the objectives when formulating serve as hypotheses need to evaluate the process of showing whether they are true or mistake.
- Know the extent to which educational goals unwanted.
- Diagnosis and deciding the curriculum's strong and weak points, so in order to enhance the strengths and weaknesses of the treatment.
- Help improve the educational process by determining the level of the progress of students toward educational goals established, and take the necessary decisions to enable them to collect those goals required level.
- Enable teachers to discover the effectiveness of educational efforts in bringing about the desired learning outcomes.
- Enable learners to see their progress and identify strengths and weaknesses in their performance.

The aims of the evaluation are:

- Diagnostic Evaluation: aims to detect the problems and difficulties and highlight and identify its causes to help treat them.
- Eclectic calendar: It aims to pick and choose the best inputs, processes education system, and then get better outputs and outcomes of that system.
- Formative assessment (builders) and aims to provide feedback on all elements of education at all stages and steps system, and the statement of strength and vulnerability indicators in each of them, and modify what may exist shortcomings aphid, and builders are overlapped.
- Congregational evaluation or final: It aims to issue a final judgment on the outcomes and outputs of the educational process and the extent of quality, such as tracing the graduates of university education in a particular area to see how they benefit from their studies in the process of life, and the appropriateness of the composition of the labor market, and the extent of their

success in their jobs. Also another benefit of the evaluation to see how useful a row students study in a substance in the rest of the subjects in a single program, or take advantage of an earlier stage of education in the next stage to them, and this tracking is useful in linking stages of the educational process to each other, and learning educational life linking.

 Therapeutic Evaluation (remedial or corrective) and aims to take the decisions and actions of reform and therapeutic deficiencies or weaknesses or problems and obstacles that might hinder the education system or any of its elements. And treatment essential function for any calendar in the domain of education process.

# <span id="page-47-0"></span>**CHAPTER II: EDUCATIONALTEACHING, LEARNING STRATEGIES AND THE ROLE "OF E-LEARNING**

Chapter Two aims to find a suitable definition for teaching as a concept, as well as describing the most important teaching methods, strategies, and models, while taking into consideration the traditional concepts and the modern ones.

Nowadays, the organization of scholar teaching not only refers to contents, but also to methods and manners of delivering information. It matters more how we learn, than what we learn, which is why in this chapter I will try to enquire if the modern methods of teaching have drastically changed in comparison to the traditional ones.

Society nowadays relies very much on technology so, what we expect is both of teachers and learners will have the needed set of skills in order to successfully manage their tasks on a daily basis. It should be expected that the teaching aids have also changed and evolved.

## <span id="page-48-0"></span>**1. The concept of teaching**

"DEFINITION OF TEACHING: 1. the act, practice, or profession of a teacher; 2. something taught; especially: doctrine <the teachings of Confucius>" [The Merriam-Webster dictionary].

Learning is found not only in humans, but also in animal behavior and in the entire living forms of live, being strictly related to the concept of adaptation. Some researchers even define learning as the process of adaptation of the living organism to the environment. The main science that started defining and became preoccupied with the concept of teaching, however, it was not biology, but psychology, and more specific Herman Ebbinghaus, Edward Thordike and John B. Watson. Since psychology has many approaches, it is fair to have many approaches to the concept and definitions of teaching as well.

In the narrow sense, learning is synonymous with school learning, which are specific and specific

to which we will continue to refer. Learning can be approached from a triple perspective: as a process, depending on various factors and product (Neacsu, 2015).

Teaching is also strictly related the one of learning. Widely, the concept of learning can be understood as the mental function trough which a person can attain new information, skills, values, meanings, knowledge and references by using their capacity of perceiving information. The process of learning is a long term process and it develops throughout one's entire life, being emphasized by the modification produced in the behavior of the individual.

Most definitions given by psychologists put a great emphasis on the behavior of the person, when it comes to defining the teaching process as well. The psychologist Clausse A. (1967) defined learning as "a modification in behavior, realized by finding a solution to a problem that puts the individual in relation to the environment". One of the first definitions of psychology was made by the Russian psychologist Leontiev, and it differs, as expected, being defined as" the assimilation of the experience of the species, the sociocultural experience of humanity". Gange R. (1975) defined teaching as "a modification of the disposition or of the human capacity which can be maintained and cannot be attributed to the growth process".

The psychologists and theoreticians who perceive the teaching concept as a change in behavior underline the fact that the changes produced in the behavior are not always a direct result of learning, but a consequence of the individual experience. Also that change in behavior must be able to be sustained in time, since learning is perceived by the same researchers as a systematic activity, directed in an organized environment, oriented in assimilating knowledge and creating psychical structures and personality structures. The subject of education psychology and objectives of this discipline are represented within the system of the science of education, the theoretical and practical importance of education psychology consisting of aspects of initial and continuing teacher education (Neacsu, 2015).

The learning that is developed in an institution is called scholar learning. Nowadays, the organization of scholar teaching not only refers to contents, but also to methods and manners of delivering information. It matters more how we learn, than what we learn. Teaching mus not lead to simple cumuls of information, but to a capacity of orientation, thinking and creativity. It must lead to a flexibility of cognitive structures and allow an optimal adaptation to the quick changes in our daily life.

Linhart classifies learning such as direct, intentional and indirect. According to content criteria, the following types of learning have been identified:

• Habituation or learning trough habit, which manifests within the sensorial adaptation as attenuation of the initial effect of a stimulus, as consequence of prolonging the action in tme or increasing the frequency

• Learning trough classic conditioning (pavlovian), which is realized in the plan of the first semnalization system (temporary connection with the fizical stimuli), or in the plan of the second semnalization system (the connection with the physical and concrete stimuli and their verbal nominations, as it happens in the forming of concepts (Salavastru, 2004)

• Learning trough instrumental conditioning (Skinnerian learning), which consists in establishing an adaptive connection between the behavioral sequences and the elements of the external situation (reward or punishment);

• Perceptive learning, which has a very high cognitive importance. It is responsible for learning signs, simbols and shapes used in different siences and it has a huge importance in behavior since it can identify and interpret stimulus and figure codes.;

 Motric learning, which is reflected in articulating simple movements , in functional unitary integrated systems or with fubak instrumental value, subordinated to solving work tasks, as in sport and ballet ; (Salavastru, 2004)

• Verbal learning, which, on one hand, facilitates growth and enriches the internal vocabulary, on the other hand, it ensures the disclosure and fixation of semantic links between words and syntax (Salavastru, 2004).

Taking as a starting point the variability of learning conditions, Robert Gange has also identified still as many forms or learning types, which are invoked in a hierarchical order.

A superior type of learning, which is situated within a higher percentage is usually placed within the levels of learning and Gagne has identified eight types which I will present below.

- (1) Signals learning, which envisages classic Pavlov's conditioned reflex. An important feature is that the individual learns to give a general answer, diffusely, triggered by a specific signal. This is an involuntary learning example, directly related to the primary emotions and vital needs. Learning the signals takes place in each of our lives. We learn to respond to the red light, we have a reaction to the alarm clock, to the ringing bell at school etc. learning signals is sometimes used by the teacher to create a state of attention to students. A teacher can use deliberately clap, for example, as a signal to make them attentive students. (Gagne, 1975).
- (2) Stimulus-response learning, corresponding to Skinner's operant conditioning. It differs from the previous form by the fact that the subject is able to discern and give a specific response to a determined stimulus. Instead of having a general emotional reaction, the individual may achieve a precisely defined action. Holding a pencil to correct a toddler is one example of learning revealed S-R. Initially, the pen can be placed in a correct position in his child by a teacher or parent. This process is repeated two or three times. After a number of repetitions strengthened, the correct answer is becoming increasingly likely.
- (3) Chaining is also a form of simple learning, it is formally called "Learning Sequences" and involves learning a series of SR knots chained in determined order. Some of the examples Gange offers are learning to swim, riding on a bicycle, typing. (Gange, 1975).
- (4) Learning of verbal associations implies series of connections of verbal type. The formation of verbal chains are formed when learning new words from a language and using them in sentences. This form of learning uses the memory very much. The German psychologist Hermann Ebbighause showed that you can learn very much trough verbal associations.
- (5) Learning by discrimination, in which the subject learns to respond differently to those features of objects that serve to distinguish them: shapes, sizes, colors. Acquiring discrimination is an activity of great importance in training school. The student learns to differentiate printed letters, numbers, colors, phonemes, and then learns the distinguishing features of classes of objects in the environment he lives in (birds, flowers, and cars).
- (6) Learning concepts, means that the subject can categorize objects based on common properties. Training is very important in learning concepts from small classes, then throughout the school period, due to the fact that the student is required to classify objects and events. An essential role to the process is played by concepts. Once the concepts are learned, the individual is prepared to assimilate a large body of knowledge.
- (7) Learning rules is based on learning concepts. In the simplest terms, a rule is a chain of two or more concepts. Gange defines the rule as "an internal capacity which offers the individual the opportunity to respond to a class of situations stimulus with a class performance, the latter being predictably linked to the first one by class relations. Much of the school learning process is about learning rules.
- (8) Problem Solving is a type of learning which requires internal efforts commonly called thinking. It can be seen as a process by which the previously learned rules are combined with the aim of finding a solution to a problematic situation. Solving problems is not just an application of rules previously learned, but a process that generates new learning, learning new ideas that multiplies the applicability of the rules previously learned. (Gange, 1975)

Gange considered that learning hierarchy provides a basis for finding a way of teaching that would be adequate for each student. For this, the most important thing is to find out what the student knows at that time in order to start training from that point.

All learning types must be taken into consideration when it comes to teaching, making a lesson plan, creating a curricula and in all processes that involve the organization of teaching, which is why I considered it would be of great importance to reveal and describe the main types of learning.

I will further discuss the concept of the traditional teaching concept and the modern teaching concept.

## <span id="page-52-0"></span>**2. Traditional teaching and modern teaching concepts**

The concept of teaching has changed throughout the years, as society changed and evolved, new teaching tools emerged and technology advanced. There is now a debate between which type of teaching is more effective, but in reality teaching is now using elements from both the traditional method and the modern one.

Actually, traditional education is found as the long-established customs as in schools which traditionally considered appropriate. The first characteristic of traditional teaching refers to the number of students, so in a traditional classroom environment, there are usually twenty to thirty children and one teacher. In the traditional teaching model, the concept of teaching is based on the frontal triad, which is the study of the manual, or curricula, and the evaluation.

This concept implies a passive learning model, since the teacher has the responsibility to deliver the information through a passive receptor, who must memorize and reproduce the information. Another key element that "traditional teaching implies is the classroom, in the sense that a number of students, in the traditional case twenty to thirty, must be present and the lesson is being taught face-to face." (Kotkin, 1998)

The traditional classroom environment has many benefits, as has also disadvantages. One of the major advantages would be that it supports efficient learning, in comparison to the increasingly popular virtual classrooms and online learning platforms, "where in a year or two, students can earn a diploma without even knowing their teachers or colleagues. Most students consider the traditional classroom environment beneficial for learning also because they can interact with the teacher and their classmates," (Kotkin, 1998) they can ask questions in real time, discuss homework, address questions when there is a misunderstanding, work in teams and groups. Students who prefer this old concept are those who need feedback and reinsurance that what they do is correct, so that they need to ask and receive immediate answers.

Also there are people who do not adapt to the new technological environment, and there still are students who did not have access to technological devices, or did not know how to use them. These people are more accustomed to the traditional teaching methods and concept, when the teachers is sharing his knowledge with the students and the students passively take notes, ask questions and assimilate the information. Also for students who have specializations that do not imply and are not related to the use of technology, books, printed courses, notes, traditional educational aids are enough to create an effective learning process (Kotkin, 1998).

In terms of organization, the traditional teaching methods imply a fixed schedule. Adults tend to have a busy life nowadays, so it depends on each individual. For younger students fixed schedules seem to be more motivating, whereas for adults and older individuals, who already have a family or a demanding job, an e-learning platform or a modern concept of teaching would seem more appropriate.

Generally speaking, these would be the main differences between the two concepts of teaching.

Although there is also a paradigm shift from the traditional teaching concept to the new one, and this shift consists in the fact that the modern learning and teaching method is more interactive, not passive like in the traditional one and is more oriented towards the students, their learning types and habits and it involves a higher level of cooperation, collaboration and discussions between the teachers and students regarding the delivery methods of knowledge and information.

The modern concept of teaching does not focus that much on achieving the curriculum goals and objectives, but more on how to best achieve the curriculum goals and objectives in a manner that is most appropriate for the students, for further facilitate the learning process and increase motivation and interest. It also implies not only passively learning new information, but also developing new skills that would prove useful in the work market.

Arguments related to the educational policies in the world mention that school today is opened in a flexible and positive manner towards all children. Today, education is extened to everyone, given their particularities and ages. It is all about a new vision regarding the expectations of the school and methods of education (Vrășmaș și Vrășmaș, 2008)

Globalization, technological advances, demographic shifts and individual's habits demand a change in education systems, this is how the modern education concept developed. In the current context, education is a lifelong learning process and e necessity, people need to constantly update their skills in order to respond to the socio-economic context and shift. Adapting to these changes in society, there have also been changes in the curriculum concept, and the concept of new curriculum emerged as well. The modern concept of the curriculum underlines that the curriculum changed, at the same time with the development and progress of science and research, especially for those which emphasized the need to adapt the curriculum for learners instead of preexisting conditioning given to students. The curriculum has been defined by the modern concept also by the use of several definitions, including the following:

A set of regular activities: the content, the tools, the teaching aids, provided under the supervision of the school, in order to prepare students for an effective learning and for a good life. A variety of experiences that are formed, which are created in order to allow the learner to pass.

The range of guided experiences adopted by the community leaders as they will be achieved, ending in benefitting the emerging growth and success of personal and social planning, under the supervision of the school (Hindi et al., 2008). All the experiences planned inside and outside the school, in order to achieve the overall growth of the learner in all aspects of his personality, including the achievement of his objectives and building a proper behavior, as well as modifying the unwanted behavior so that he will be a good citizen (Al-Shibli , 2000).

Total diverse expertise offered by the school to students inside and outside the school, in order for them to achieve an integrated development in the building of human beings, according to specific educational goals and according to the scientific plans drawn, physically, mentally, psychologically, socially and religiously (Shehata ,1998).

The concept exceeds the knowledge taught and it deals with all the ingredients that work together to formulate an educational output and print a special character, achieving an involuntary personal decency which must be integrated, including the spiritual, mental, physical and social aspects. It features a modern concept of curriculum that:

- a) Is not limited to the texts and information of the textbook content alone, but rather deal with it as a component of the curriculum components and a means for its implementation.
- b) The implementation of the curriculum is no longer restricted to the activity that is within the school, but also to all extra-curricular activities that take place outside the school.
- c) The main concern is not only forming the student's mind, but also seeking to achieve the overall growth of his personality, in all aspects.
- d) The care is focused on building a passive behavior of the learner rather than charging his mind and theory of knowledge, regardless of his values and instinct.
- e) There is comprehensive care granted to the planning of integrated educational experiences that help the learner to learn and to build a proper behavior.
- f) There is an interest in setting clearly the educational goals and the different levels and working the way up to achieve them.
- g) Care is given to the actual yield of the educational process of the individuals and of the community as a whole. '(Al-Shibli, 2000).

So, the difference between the traditional and modern concept of teaching is being perceived at the level of curriculum as well, which further in this chapter will be shown to identify changes in the teaching strategies and methods as well.

## <span id="page-56-0"></span>**3. Teaching strategies and methods**

It seems "There are different types of teaching methods which can be categorized into three broad types, these are teacher-centered methods, learnercentered methods, content-focused methods and interactive/participative methods." (Raj, 2014) All teaching methods have functions, and I will try to describe all of them below.

The functions of teaching methods are:

- Communicative it implies the transmission of new knowledge, abilities, skills and attitudes
- Cognitive it implies attaining new information
- Normative- it involves organization, direction and constant correction of the teaching process
- Motivational it must maintain and trigger the interest of the students, their curiosity
- Instrumental and operational- the teachers has the role of a mediator since it mediates access to knowledge, it choses methods, strategies, models (Kochhar, 2004).

I will further try to include and describe each type of teaching methods, focusing also on their definition and differences with strategies and models, taking into account the traditional or basic teaching models and the new modern ones derived from the modern concept of teaching.

#### **3.1. Teaching strategies**

A teaching strategy represents the fundamental role and methods of teaching which may vary achieve the grade level, the type of subject being taught and the educational environment, or whether the teaching methods are traditional or modern, or if it is a distance-based learning or an in-class face-to face type of education. It mainly represents the way a teacher chooses to deliver information, facilitate learning and on the tools he or she chooses as teaching aids.

Generally speaking, there are two main types of teaching strategies: active learning, which directly involves students to analyze course materials, such as manuals, books, notes, it implies giving a lecture, homework, group discussions, team projects and is characterized by independent studies and interactive methods of teaching., whereas the other type of teaching strategy is called inclusive instruction.

Inclusive instruction means that the teachers can use their strategy base onto learning types of their students, is based on a student-oriented approach. It differs from the active learning strategy because it does not involve using only one method for all the students, but several methods since each student has different learning strategies. The goal of this strategy is therefore to adapt to learning styles, so it is more experimental.

The most widely used "teaching strategies are:

- direct instruction,
- indirect instruction,
- interactive instruction,
- independent study and
- experimental learning." (Rowe et al, 1998).

#### **3.2. Basic teaching methods**

The basic teaching methods involve methods such as explanations, narrative exposure, description, and lecture and they all refer to methods of oral communication. The written communication in education and teaching is often realized through books, teaching materials, presentation, manuals and so on. The oral teaching methods can be expositive, conservative, methods of direct explorations of reality, methods of indirect exploration of reality, and methods of simulated action. I will further try to give more details about each type.

#### **a) Expositive methods include:**

- Explanation which is used to offer and reveal information, situations, laws, rules, hypothesis and they all require argumentation and analysis as processes.
- Narrative exposure- mean exposing the content of the lesson as if it were a story, using an emotional basis and a plastic one.
- Description is the analytical presentation of the properties of objects and phenomena.
- Lecture is the systematic exposure of a high volume of information and knowledge and is one of the most common method, especially in higher education.

#### **b) Conservative methods include:**

- Conversation- which is a didactical dialog realized through a succession of questions and answers. Usually the students asks question and the teacher answers, or during an evaluation the teachers is the one to interrogate the student in order to test their level of knowledge or acquired knowledge on a particular or various subjects (Kochhar, 2004).

The types of conversation can be introductive, ritualizing, fixing, checking, heuristic, etc. The questions as well can be reproductive, simulative, applicative, evaluative, and inversed or returned.

#### **c) The methods of direct exploration of reality**

These methods usually follow the systematic recording of the data on objects and phenomena with the purpose of deepening the students' knowledge. They have various forms, since they can be directed, independent, spontaneous, of short-term.

In subjects such as physics, chemistry and biology these methods can also be experimental, by intentionally creating a phenomena with the purpose of studying it. These methods are also called laboratory methods.

#### **d) Methods of indirect exploration of reality**

#### **These methods include:**

- The demonstration- presentation of the objects and real phenomena or substitues of those, based on a material aid – natural, figurative, symbolic.
- Modelling- which means using models in order to represents in an essential, simplified manner the characteristics of objects and phenomena, which are difficult to explore directly or which are unavailable to explore directly.

#### **e) Simulated methods of exploring reality**

These methods involve the use of fictive or simulated action upon reality, such as:

- Didactical game which combines the instructive and formative elements with the distractive ones and be used in teaching different learning disciplines. The games can be sensorial, mathematical, orientative, creative, practical, motric.
- Simulated learning- involves the use of artificial technical methods build by analogy to the original ones (Ionescu, 2000).

These are all basic methods of teaching and usually they are used in combination, according to teacher's preferences and to the student's needs, in order to better acquire the educational goals of the lesson being taught.

## <span id="page-60-0"></span>**4. Modern teaching methods**

The transition to modernity, from the pedagogical perspective is a change of strategies, optics an educational practices, which is already in development. (Peacock, 2002). The science of education is also in the constructivist era and constructivism elicits a shift of paradigm as well, like it was the case for the curriculum – it is a shift from a normative model to an interpretative one.

Applied in the educational sciences, the constructivist concept involves "the shift of educational paradigm, from the behaviorist transmission of knowledge to the approach based on communication and cooperation, in which not only the teacher, but the student as well has an active role (Păcurari, et al, 2003).

The focus is shifted from the object of study to the student, to his needs, to the students' interests and aspirations, to his subjectivity, and it aims to deliver the most adequate teaching plan that would be efficient in order for the student to develop new skills and understand the transmitted information, and also be able to use it, not only to pass an evaluation or an examination (Al-Dulaimi et al, 2017).

The most important elements in modern teaching have the following applicative principles:

- "Moving the focus from the teaching object to the teaching centered on the student's needs rhythm and abilities;
- Reconsidering the role of the teacher as main and sole organizer of the teaching process and involving the students as well;
- Take into consideration the students when it comes to the necessity of their involvement to their own training ;
- Encouraging and stimulating active participation of the students in the planification of their of scholar curriculum, such as choosing what languages to learn, extra activities etc;
- Differentiating the teaching methods according to the students' different styles of learning." (Ionescu, 2000)

Thus the teaching methods become instruments which can be valorized by the teacher in order to ensure the efficiency of the learning process. The main characteristics of the interactive teaching methods are:

- (1) "Group strategies these involve the collaboration of the students" which can be divided into various groups or teams with the purpose of finding solutions to a problem, or creating a project, or completing a given task (Oprea, 2006);
- (2) Creating programs that correspond to the differentiated answers to the students' reactions (Oprea, 2006);
- (3) Sustaining active learning and encouraging it, "meaning that the students learns and takes action on the information in order to develop the ability to transform it in a personal one." (Oprea, 2006);
- (4) Stimulating the participation of the students to action, socializing and developing their complex cognitive processes and their capacity of understanding, self-evaluating and self-organizing by using active methods of teaching (Oprea, 2006, 28).

These interactive teaching methods promote an active learning processes and the teachers place a higher emphasis no longer on on the informational but on his or her role as organizer, mediator of the learning/ teaching activities. This way, the teachers offers to his or her students the occasion to get involved in their own training and freely express their ideas, opinions, allowing them to develop the metacognitive competences.

Friedrich Wilheim August Froebel was a German educator and the first one to create a new respect for the individuality of the child, by means of initiative, cooperation and collaboration in the educational process. He was also the first one who believed in building the curriculum around the children's interests, considering that their interest is a symptom of their potentialities, which is the basis of modern approaches in the psychology of education nowadays.

The educational environment is also adapting and integrating the use of technology, so this shift promoted the use of new materials and teaching aids as well. Teachers have found that many teaching problems can be easily solved by the proper use of these aids.

## <span id="page-62-0"></span>**1. Teaching models/ E-learning/ E-learning strategies**

A teaching model is a frame from the application of an approach, strategy, methods, and techniques of teaching and it involves a series of strategies, methods, and techniques in a single unified whole. Therefore, the teaching model is basically a form of teaching which is reflected from start to finish and is typically presented and chosen by the teacher or the educational institution.

#### **The relationship between the strategy, the manner, and the method**

This section is dedicated to underlying the relationship between three important concepts in teaching: the strategy, the manner or model and the method. I will begin by differentiating them and characterizing each concept.

The teaching method refers to the path which will be followed in the common activity of teachers and students, in order to achieve and attain the goals of instruction. The teaching manner is a component of the method, a more limited action technique. It can be considered more like a support aid or a concrete manner of giving value to the method. The report between the method and teaching manner therefore is a complementary one.

#### **5.1. E-learning**

Online learning platforms, or e-learning, is created to sustain the individual learning process and allow users and students to access a series of informational resources on online environments, allowing them to engage in a series of debates on various themes "E-learning is not created in order to replace the traditional educational systems, but to act as an aid in the learning / teaching process. It has been adopted by the educational institutions as an alternative to the traditional educational strategies, being complementary to the school activity." (Rosenberg, 2001)This type of platform is designed for active learning, it involves the use of an internet connection and of a computer. For teachers it can be a useful teaching aid and it can help stimulate students to use their spare time more usefully, creating activities specific to each subject or discipline.

E-learning has many benefits, and disadvantages as well. The first benefit is that it can engage a wider audience, since a virtual classroom is not limited to a number of students, the physical limitations being overcome.

E-learning can be fully operational, or as I described earlier can function as an aid in the traditional education system. Bates and Poole describe the functions of Elearning graphically as it is shown in the figure below. (Figure, 1)

#### *Figure 1. The continuum of e-learning, by Bates and Poole (2003)*

This type of learning is suited for adults who have a hig-demanding job, or have a very busy life, since it allows a more flexible type of learning in terms of schedule. According to a recent survey in 2002 "over 1.6 million students in degreegranting higher education institutions in the USA took at least one online course in the fall semester of 2002 (11% of all U.S. higher education students), and over 500,000 took all their courses online. Also, The Open University of Catalonia in Spain and Athabasca University in Canada, have over 20,000 students each, and most of the courses from these three institutions are fully online." (Allen and Seaman, 2003)

E-learning can "offer effective instructional methods, such as practicing with associated feedback, combining collaboration activities with individual study, personalizing learning paths based on learners' needs and using simulation." Other advantages include the fact that e-learning engages various teaching methods, most of them audio-visual methods. According to recent research, visual materials enhance the learning process.

According to Mohanty "the use of visual aids in teaching learning process has multifarious values" (Mohanty, 2001), since visual aids "give chance to speakers to make a more professional and consistent performance. By visual aids in teaching is one mode to enhance lesson plans and give students additional ways to process subject information." (Kunari, 2006) As I also mentioned earlier, the use of audiovisual materials if very effective in language teaching lessons, "since the audio-visual resources can help solve certain language barrier problem as they provide accurate visual image and make learning easier for the student." (Chacko, 1981)

#### **5. 2. E-learning strategies**

E-learning has two main approaches, it can be based on individual study or it can be facilitated by a teacher. Individual study is, of course completely independent so the strategies are fully chosen by the student, according to his or her preferences.

E-learning courses facilitated by a teacher will guide his students as their guide and not as their instructor, creating the highest collaboration and using a very interactive approach. Often, e-learning courses combine both approaches. In terms of educational methods and policies, currently e-learning platforms have them under development.( Figure, 2)

*Figure 2. Development of e-learning policies (Rosenberg, 2001).*

Even though the e-learning policies are under development, ADDIE model is one of the most popular models and it can be explained as follows. (Figure 3)

#### *Figure 3. The Addie model for e-learning. [\(http://www.tonybates.ca/](http://www.tonybates.ca/) - online learning resources),*

The main activities which can be performed within an e-learning platform are:

- accessing e-courses reading, taking notes, listening to audio resources or watching video resources
- deadline based assignments
- chat or forum for debates or discussions
- Web conference (Al-Dulaimi si Vrăsmaș, 2017).

Advanced eLearning – AEL is used in most schools in Romania. AEL is a complete integrated platform and it offers support for teaching and learning, testing and evaluation, having a curricular concept.

In AEL, the content can be structured and adapted accorning to the student's needs. The access rights for each user or group of users can be applied to each segment of the database of online library. The search is usually based on key words.

The e-learning platform Moodle offers communication and socializing environment, it has evaluation systems, coruses and it give students the possibility of virtually working togethers. The main educational resource is represented by the ecourse, which consists of lessons or weekly activities, assingments and homework. Ath the end of a course module, the evaluation module is activated. The evaluation system is flexible and allows the trainer to establish more evaluation modialities. Teachers can post activities and students can post the assignments for feedback, grade or can make commentaries and debates.

The Moodle infrastructure supports many types of plugins, such as:

- -activities (game words, puzzles)
- resource types (multiple answers, trugh or false)
- -graphic themes
- authentification methods with usernames and passowrds
- content filters.

Wikispaces is another well-known learning platform which is particularly interesting since users can load notes for classwork or creat interesting multimedia projects. Wikispaces can be used as simple websites, as project groups, in order to manage school documents, for debates or collaboration with other students or teachers, nationally and internationally. It was designed in order to be easy to use and fun, for teachers and students to be able to focus on what they want to achieve, so that the design is the most user-friendly in comparison to the other platforms.

iTeach is a 2.0 platform which allows teachers to collaborate in a highly advanced virtual environment.

Blackboard – offers the technical support required for the e-courses which are created according to the formative learning continutului based on a precise teaching strategy.

The projection of teaching in e-learning is called instructional design, and it is a systematic process, based on analysis and projection. It usually has four components: students, objectives, methods and evaluation and it consists in identifying the instruction needs in order to generate the e-learning strategy. The e-learning strategy is usually produced by a team consisting in experts on the taught discipline, in programming, copyright law, content writers etc. (Bullen, 2007)

According to Bates and Poole (2003), e-learning emerged just at the appropriate timeframe when constructivist approaches to teaching were very popular and for constructivists, it is only through discussion students will come to control their timing and gain the needed one step ahead, the thing which will allow their teacher to encourage their reflection, this will bring us to the importance of the online forms which will highlight the importance of the space and time given to students' discussion during the online sessions.

"For distance education aimed at the masses, and in particular those excluded from traditional forms of education, e-learning education are likely to remain important for many years to come" since the educational e-learning platforms offer studying opportunities for those with a busy schedule, they act as a teaching aid, and they promote active learning and are very accessible. One of the major advantages are that they stimulate interactivity and collaboration, the mobility and geographic independence, the fact that they can engage a higher audience and the individualization of the learning process which is a great benefit for the individual who can learn at his or her own pace and receive feedback (Al-Dulaimi și Vrășmaș, 2017).

## <span id="page-67-0"></span>**2. E-learning competencies**

Broadly speaking, e-learning means the totality of educational situations in which the means of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) are used significantly. The term, taken from the Anglo-Saxon literature, has been extended from the primary etymological sense of electronic learning, now covering the area of intersection of educational actions with modern computer resources. In the modern concept, the resource-based learning process uses both classical models with known media (physical models) and virtual models of multimedia technology. e-learning is a component of a technology-based model (Harper, 2008).

A characterization of e-learning can be based on the following:

- The learning process is oriented towards the trained and is done in a virtual location

- Educational resources are accessible on the Web and distributed through the use, integration, access to electronic libraries and multimedia materials, training of specialists in subjects' discussions

- Trainings benefit from the guidance of a tutor (instructor, moderator) who schedules the activity of the group of participants, subjects them to the topics in the course, asynchronous conferences (discussion forums, blogs), or synchronous (chat, virtual class) auxiliary resources, comments on themes, requires directions.

- through interaction and collaboration, the group of participants forms, during the course (often and after), a virtual community; they can be characterized by the socalled "fluidity of roles", through the continuous balance of the instructor-trained role in the learning group ("symmetric knowledge advancement" - Scardamalia, 1995), through the continuous restructuring of the learning teams according to interests or objectives

- The course material has a static component, the one prepared by the tutor together with a specialized team, and a dynamic one, resulting from the interaction of the participants, suggestions, comments, resources

- Most e-learning environments allow participants to monitor activity, and some and simulations, group work, audio, video interaction .

Currently, the term e-learning has practically replaced all the terms that have meant a new way of integrating ICT in the training process. The National Academic Evaluation and Accreditation Council (CNEAA) has established a set of "Standards for the use of e-learning platforms in distance learning". These refer to:

- services offered to students
- specific learning resources
- services provided to the teaching staff
- accessibility to the services provided by the e-learning platform
- quality management of platform services
- documents submitted by the institution

Competency Training specializes in the development of e-Learning solutions so e-Learning courses incorporate multimedia elements to make them engaging for students, and assessments to ensure that learning outcomes are robust. Teaching and learning with ICT requires specific competencies for teachers and lectures. Too much attention was given to the technological aspects. Teachers learned to work with hardand software. A typical example is the European Computer Driving License (ECDL) (Beaudoin et al, 2018).

A lot of people attend courses on text processing, spreadsheets, but using a Virtual Learning Environment like e.g. Blackboard or Moodle demands more didactical than technical skills. Especially e-learning and blended learning is too demanding to let teachers learn to use these tools only by experimenting. More and more is generally accepted that the e-learning competencies for teachers require a longer course (Cristobal et al, 2009).

According to Kellie McRobert, the five maine e-learning competencies are:

- e-Awareness awareness of ICTs and their relevance in society, including digital citizenship
- Digital literacy using technology for information and knowledge (students locate, organise, create, adapt, and share information)
- Media literacy understanding the manipulation and the way that digital media crosses over with mainstream media
- Informational literacy understanding and interpreting information from different sources
- Technological literacy confident and critical operation of ICTs.

We think of e-awareness as the most conceptual and strategic of digital skills. It can be defined as the ability to understand the real impact of the changes brought by the Information Society in one's context. At another level, e-Awareness would also imply foreseeing and anticipating such changes, either to avoid or smooth their impact, or to benefit from them by adapting one's behavior.

Digital literacy is an individual's ability to access both information and methods of communication through a technologic tools including, but not limited to, smartphones, tablets, laptops, and traditional desktop PCs.

Media literacy typically lends itself to a deeper meaning and analysis of the work, not necessarily just a direct understanding of fact represented in the work. Media literacy also concerns the ability to identify when there is a problem that impacts democracy thus allowing the public to generate its own opinion, which can influence society.

According to Al-Dulaimi,"information literacy is related to information technology skills, but has broader implications for the individual, the educational system, and for society. Information technology skills enable an individual to use computers, software applications, databases, and other technologies to achieve a wide variety of academic, work-related, and personal goals. Information literate individuals necessarily develop some technology skills" ( AL-Dulaimi, 2017). Information literacy can only be eliminated with the use of technological skills.

Educational technology is a symbol of the progress of science and technology defines the modern life has become the most important way we can use to organize and prepare a studies and materials for the study, since it can be used to achieve the educational goals based on scientific and technical progress.

Educational technology can be perceived differently according to the author's perception due to the diversity of its field, since it implies knowledge from pedagogy and didactics, computer science and information, psychology and sociology. The nature of this discipline is multidisciplinary and it requires an interdisciplinary approach.

Nowadays the limited use of computers at schools unfortunately and technology is not yet integrated in the educational technology, therefore it is not exploited at its full potential and students do not benefit from an early training that would provide a more authentic, efficient and interactive learning experience with the help of which they could enhance their communication skills, their analytical and problem-solving skills, their creativity and their own motivation. It has been prior mentioned that some critics consider that technology could have a bad impact on children but it has been proved by many studies that this idea is not sustained by considerable proofs.

Although we live in a modern digital age where the our methods of teaching are still outdated. The reasons for this are various, one of them is that some of the instructors lack the necessary training in order to use technology efficiently and creatively in order for the students to benefit the most of what this new digital era provides, this is why schools should also invest in training the teachers in educational technology. Another reason might be that some schools cannot afford the equipment and some of the school leaders do not have sufficient qualification to access and implement national and international funds.

It has become a necessity to expand and diversify the educational strategies and the use of Education technologies in education, in order to achieve many of the educational goals.

The modern technologies added a lot of development to our daily life, it is only normal that many aspects have also changed in the student's life and their habits as well, therefore it should and does have an impact on education and this impact consists in the fact that technology should become part of the education program (Culp et al., 2003; Johnson, 2000). According to Bonifaz and Zucker (2004), integrating technology and educational technology in the curriculum would increase the engagement of students, would make it easier for them achieve the educational goals by creating a more active learning environment and would better fit their educational needs and skills.

Educational technology does not imply the fact that students must use individual computers only (Means, 2000). , it can involve networking – videoconference, digital television- and other applications that allow students to interact with programs, such as includes digital cameras and electronic whiteboards (Marshall 2004).

Researchers have suggested that technology can enhance learning, since technology can improve some skills of the students, such as communication skills, by using word processing programs and communicating via e-mail, or organizational skills and the capacity to better understand science concepts by using modeling software (such as Matlab), database programs, animations, graphs, spreadsheet programs or by using the modern technologies to design many helpful softwares, editing software for digital images and videos (Honey et al., 2005; Johnston, 2000; Means, 2000).

According to recent literature, students are deeply impacted by the use of technological devices and softwares in academic results (Guleck et al., 2005). Stratham and Torell (1999) came to the conclusion that if technological aspects are used in the right way within the education program resulted into an interactive relationship based on feedback between the teachers and students and showed enhanced skills of problem solving and inquiry, therefore higher engagement of the students in the educational program, which led to lower dropout rates.

After the implementation of Microsoft played a good role by supplying and donating many free laptops to many schools around the world which impacted their progress and added to their interest at school (Gulek and Demirtas, 2005). Apple also had a similar program, the first of this kind, called Apple Classrooms of Tomorrow (ACOT) through which they provided a full access to computers to many students and teachers, from 1985 to 1998 and their evaluations after the implementation of the technology also revealed that students had better communication skills, enhanced problem-solving skills and the students were able to learn independently (Means, 2000; Weston et al., 2010).

However, studies also indicate that students are not the only ones who might be making a full use of technology in teaching methods, since teachers might also benefit from the ability to create course materials and deliver lessons in a more authentic way, providing additional sources of information and delivering the information in a more interactive way (Healey, 2001; Waddoups, 2004).

Research indicates teacher's ability to use technology inside the classroom and teaching strategies is very important (Valdez, 2005; Jackson 2004), therefore determining teachers' lavel of computer skills before designing professional development (Bonifaz & Zucker, 2004). According to Cooley (2001) it is very important to prepare teachers to implement the program of educational technology, since the technology itself cannot do much for the student.

In the past few years, deciding what should be used and how to use technology in education have been questioned (Culp et al., 2003), but studies suggest that the types of technology that should be used and the ways to used that technology should be fit and suitable for learners' usage and for the school's teaching methods and goals, adapting to the curricula in order to help achieving the expected results (Sivin and Bialo, 2000).

According to Honey et al. (2005), detailed planning is the main factor for the implementation of technology programs and that those in charge of the organizational parte should find the best fit for the school's primary goals, and according to those goals to find ways in which the technology will be helpful, functioning as and aid that can be integrated in educational plans. It is also important that the students and teachers as wells receive professional training facilitating the integrating of technologies in teaching methods (Gahala, 2001).

The US and Finland were the first countries to implement Educational technology in the compulsory education program in 1988 and 1991. The educational programs created for the discipline were based on the identification of the elements specific to the informational systems, the transmission and management of the information in a digital format, developing informational applications that stimulate the creativity of students and enhance their analytical skills.

The implementation of the digital competences within the other disciplines takes into account the stimulation of communication as well on all levels, promoting feedback and collaboration between the students and teachers, community and society and the educational and non-educational environment. The technological competences can be developed through activities based on new technologies during the course. UNESCO recommends a series of activities, such as using basic software packages like text editing, graphic designing programs, software for making presentations or video editing software, using the educational software for interactive learning, simulations, graphs and animation for science contents and online communication via email, forums, video conferences, blogs, instant messages etc. (Vasilescu, 2010).

It is also recommended to use the Internet for research. The educational strategies and methods hould be built in such way that would allow approaching the content and competence development based on new technologies and make it possible for the teachers to organize activities with the help of the new educational software (Vasilescu, 2010).

Using technology as an important learning part experience implies providing the teachers with the opportunity to design new efficient, interactive and authentic learning experiences, and it is not actually a very difficult or pretentious change. Learners as well as instructors daily life, the changes would impact more the educational strategies and the curriculum since the teacher's task would be making the full use of the technological tools in order to deliver the content to the students. It is not enough to integrate modern technologies at schools (Cuban, 2003), here is where the role of the curricula comes in play.

According to the cognitive load theory the learning materials must be designed by teachers in a way that would minimizing our memory of work inorder to create a pattern (Sweller, 1988). Using digital learning resources, students would be able to exclude information which are not directly related to schema, they would be able to focus instead on information which does relate directly to it and identify the complexity and meaning of the materials in a more organized way. Teachers can design materials by using digital resources as part of the course or lecture, as a way to present a topic, or as a stimulus for the group (Mayer, 2008).

As mentioned earlier, in the past few years, question of how to use technologies and what pat=rt of it is the most important (Culp et al., 2003) and studies suggest that technology should be fit and suitable for students' usage and for the school's teaching methods and goals, adapting to the curricula in order to help achieving the expected results (Sivin and Bialo, 2000) and another important factor is to offer professional training to teachers and students (Gahala, 2001) in order to avoid making technology available in schools where teachers cannot make use of it, or cannot use it effectively (Cuban, 2003). One of the main task of school leaders in this regard would be to evaluate the effective use of technology and the main task of teachers would be to find meaningful ways to use technology in teaching (Sivin and Bialo, 2000).

Between the traditional lectures and lectures delivered with the use of technology, comparison studies conclude that they are both effective, as long as the ways they are used are effective (Gahala, 2001). The research also suggests that educational technology must be integrated in the curricula since education is faced with the decision regarding the implementation of technology in their daily life and in work as well, and most of the studies have shown that they are two categories of teachers: one category is willing to implement technology in their teaching methods and the other one is not. The reason appears to be that those from the first category have a better understanding of technology and of the ways they can apply it (Becker, 2000; Wang et al., 2004).

Technologies' usage within the educational framework environment has become very popular, but the Office of Technology Assessment came to the conclusion that teachers are still using modern technologies very little in the teaching process, although the technological resources were available (Mishra and Cavanaugh, 2008).

## <span id="page-75-0"></span>**4. Integrating technology and educational technology into the curriculum**

The curriculum for the educational technology and technology of information and communication is considered a normative act which is compulsory for the educational processes of this field this discipline. As a school discipline, the technology of the usage of modern technological skills which has the purpose the development of competences regarding the managing of information represented in images, texts, graphic files, audio files, video files and online files as well as online platforms and can be best based on:

- combining the process of teaching and learning of the theoretical knowledge with the practical activities using the technological devices
- adapting the taught information to the students' age
- promoting interdisciplinary
- balancing the informational load and the continuity by structuring the material according to the student's age and to the performance of the technological devices
- differentiating and individualizing the teaching methods and learning experiences
- establishing a compulsory level of training

The technological framework encourages the students' team work blogs and extend their creative skills, or be able to solve problems in discussion boards, have debates participate in other activities in cooperative ways that help the learning process become more appealing, interesting and efficient.

Students' teamwork will encourage the development of new ideas, share thoughts and write together, developing their capacity to transform acquired information into action, creating new personally interpreted information (Warschauer and Matuchniak, 2010).

The studies of educational strategies are based on strategic teaching, which is a way of making decision about how to deliver a course or even a curriculum. The decision making strategy is based on the key variables given by educational context, usually this main key variables are the learning goals, the individual interests of the students and the educational strategies preferred by the teachers.

According to these variables, there are several organizational steps taken in order to deliver a strategy. The first step after analyzing and establishing the key variables is to write informed documents about the content of the curriculum or study discipline, or even a simple course. This involves a selection of different works, manuals, bibliography and implies making decisions about what topics to include and which to leave out, based on the national curricula according to the principle of being compatible with the European Educational Standards, with the educational paradigms promoted at a European level and according to the other general principles of the educational programs or curriculum.

After the course content has been decided, the next step is to realize a structure by taking into account various factors, such as the rhythm of learning of the students, their educational interests, the available time to assimilate the information and other time resources available, the learning goals and task, the knowledge, abilities, capacities and competences of the students implied by the learning task, the methodology of teaching-learning, and the educational materiales.

The preferences of the teacher regarding the way of information delivery and teaching preferences, also called technique of delivery, is an important factor as well since it defines the process or manner by which a course or an educational module will be delivered to students. The technique of delivery may include lectures, conferences, demonstrations, discussions, assignments, experiments etc. In this step, according to the technical competencies of the teacher, decisions can be made regarding which appropriate materials and technology to employ in the classroom which is why it became a necessity to ingrate the modern technologies within the curriculum and provide technological equipment, since it could facilitate the learning environment and to develop the teachers' as well as learners' educational skills.

Students have been deeply impacted by the modern technologies academic results (Guleck et al., 2005) and according to Stratham and Torell's studies (1999) when integrated appropriately, the introduction of technology in the education program results into an interactive relationship based on feedback between the teachers and students, showing enhanced skills of problem solving and inquiry, therefore higher engagement of the students in the educational program. Apple's program "Apple Classrooms of Tomorrow (ACOT)", the evaluations reported that students were able to helps in creating and developing such programs program (Gulek and Demirtas, 2005; Means, 2000; Weston et al., 2010)..

Most recent studies have concluded that technology can enhance learning, improve the communication skills of the students by using word processing programs and communicating via e-mail, or their organizational skills and the capacity to better understand science concepts by using modeling software (such as Matlab), database programs, animations, graphs, spreadsheet programs or by using modern technologies such as digital images and videos (Honey et al., 2005; Johnston, 2000; Means, 2000).

Society nowadays relies very much on technological skills in order to successfully manage their tasks on a daily basis by using the tools technology delivers, tools meant to help us solve different problems in most of the levels of society. So improving learning outcomes, preparing students to be an active society members and maintaining a strong connection between the educational environment and society are some of the most important reasons why technology and educational skills must be involved during the operation of reforming the curriculum strategies.

The last step in planning a course is to decide upon the methods of assessment and evaluation and how to get feedback from the students. The process of planning an educational strategy or a curriculum is not an easy one and curriculum studies have been central to teacher's work, so the theory of curricula includes a third component which regards principles that refer to the teaching activity. The third component of the theory of curricula includes the following principles which act as guidelines for the education strategies:

- teachers must create diversity in the learning context and the learning situations must be adequate to the educational aims;
- they must stimulate and sustain continuously the motivation of the students, discover and develop their skills and respond to their educational interests and needs;
- the teaching activity must facilitate not only the knowledge transmission, but also the development of competences and professional skills
- teachers must provide the students with the possibility to share their knowledge and competences in an interdisciplinary way
- the teaching activity must sustain a strong relationship with the daily life and society

helping the learners to develop their own technological skills educational technology during their study, affecting their personality and carrier path later in life and provides equity of opportunity, respecting the main principles of an educational program and we stated earlier, technology's access to the use of is not a negative factor for the children's development.

Technology is the most important aid in teaching and learning, but it is not enough to use technology to transmit information, students must learn how to apply technology, so educational technology should also has an important role in classroom, and it would be time to consider technology not just an tool used to support the learning process, but an important aspect within the educational framework, as it is an integral part of our daily lives.

## <span id="page-78-0"></span>**5. Conclusions**

Nowadays, the organization of scholar teaching not only refers to contents, but also to methods and manners of delivering information. It matters more how we learn, than what we learn. Teaching mus not lead to simple cumuls of information, but to a capacity of orientation, thinking and creativity. It must lead to a flexibility of cognitive structures and allow an optimal adaptation to the quick changes in our daily life.

Society nowadays relies very much on technology so learners and instructors must have the skills in order to successfully manage their tasks on a daily basis by using the tools technology delivers, tools meant to help us solve different problems in most of the levels of society.

So improving learning outcomes, preparing learners to participate in society and maintaining a strong connection between the educational environment and society are some of the most important reasons why learning strategies are changing, and this shift appeared in the education system, promoting collaboration, interactive learning and the use of new technological teaching aids.

The technological framework helps in motivating students to extend their creative skills, or be able to solve problems in discussion boards, have debates participate in other activities in cooperative ways that help the learning process become more appealing, interesting and efficient.

Team work inside the classroom or the e-classroom, is encouraged to develop new ideas, share thoughts and write together, developing their capacity to transform acquired information into action, creating new personally interpreted information's.

# <span id="page-80-0"></span>**CHAPTER III. EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY AND IT'S COMPETENCE IN EDUCATION**

The emergence of new technologies has helped shape the new ways in which people are communicating, and forming social constructs and according to recent research that these technologies are shaping the way we think, work and learn, especially for the youngest generations. (Green & Hannon, 2007).

This "transformation" has various implications on education. Although most institutes have integrated educational technology as a tool in their work, educational institutions have been reluctant to embrace these new technologies, since traditionally education must pay a very close attention on the potential dangers of networking technologies. However, it is important to underline the fact the advances in cyber security have made new technologies quite safe.

Also the costs might be a bit raised, which also constitutes an impediment to the integration of technology. The benefits however are numerous, since digital networking platforms show to increase opportunities for learning, can increase collaboration and improve communication, so it is a problem that should be considered.

This chapter will put a higher emphasis on the role of educational technology in the development of education. Educational technology is a systematic and organized process of applying modern technology with the purpose of improving the quality of education and functioning as an aid to the educational process, such as learning and teaching, developing modern educational teaching techniques. (Green & Hannon, 2007).

Educational technology can include instructional materials and methods, which will all be discussed in this chapter.

## <span id="page-81-0"></span>**1. Evolution of educational tools and techniques**

Technology has always been used in education, starting from carving figures on rock walls to technological devices, such as laptops, mobile phones, electronic blackboards, e-books and many others. The importance of technology in education has remained constant in spite of the changes of the materials and the evolution of technology, so it would be interesting to understand how the educational tools and techniques have evolved.

#### *A history of educational tools and techniques.*

In 1870, technology started to advance, developing the Magic Lantern- a primitive version of a slide projector that projected images printed on glass plates, and the overhead projector, a more modern version, appeared in 1930.

Around 1890 the chalkboard emerged, followed by the pencil in 1900 and the ballpoint pen in 1940. In the 1920s the radio emerged, and on-air classes became a much known trend, followed by videotapes in 1951, creating a new method of instruction. The photocopier and the handheld calculator entered the educational environment in 1959, respectively 1972, allowing quick mathematical calculation.

Although the first computers were developed in 1930, they entered the educational environment in the '80s. The number of students in college in 1930 was around 1 million, but by 2012 had grown to a record 21.6 million, therefore teachers needed and developed new methods of instruction and testing, and students were looking for new ways to communicate, study, and learn.

In 1990, the Hyper Text Markup Language, or HTML, was developed and the National Science Foundation (NSF) removed restrictions on the commercial use of the Internet in 1993. This was a very important development, since it represents the foundations of distance learning and online learning platforms.

The first Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) was released by Apple Computer in 1993, and in 2009, in the US, 97% of classrooms had one or more computers, and 93% of classroom computers had Internet access (http://elearninginfographics.com). Instructors stated that 40% of students used computers often in their educational methods, in addition to interactive whiteboards and digital cameras (http://elearninginfographics.com).

## <span id="page-82-0"></span>**2. The concept and classification of teaching aids**

The term "teaching aid" was first used by Van der Stoep et al. (1973) to summarize instructional and learning aids, and they represent materials or tools that the teacher uses in presenting a lesson, or which they generally use in different lessons in order to deliver the information to the students: chalkboard, PowerPoint presentation, syllabus, etc.

The "learning aids" are the materials or tools used by students, in order to assimilate and understand information: notebooks, manuals, books, laptops, internet, etc.

In terms of classification, the most known teaching aids are:

- Audio-visual aids and media
- Technology
- Activity sheets
- Flip charts
- Felt pens and markers
- Chalk boards or black boards
- Manuals and books
- Maps
- Slide projectors
- Diagrams
- Overhead projectors
- Calculators
- E-books
- Smart rows

*Figure 4. Type of electronic equipment used in education in Romania ("The role of electronic equipment in the educational process" by Epson, 3 to 8 June 2015).*

The (figure.4) above shows the results of the study "The role of electronic equipment in the educational process" by Epson. According to their conclusions 40% of urban schools in Romania do not use electronic equipment in classroom teaching; teachers in Romania are reluctant to use electronic equipment in the educational process and approximately 90% of parents believe that the use of such devices in the classroom is necessary.

Regarding the types of electronic equipment to exposed children in the family, the results showed:

- television (87.19%),
- tablet (71.53%),
- computer desktop (70.94%),
- laptop (69.75%),
- the printer (52 19%),
- audio (46.26%),
- DVD player (38,55%),
- video (5.46%) (Epson, 2015).

Finally, the type of electronic equipment used in education resulted as follows

- computer desktop (the 72.59%),
- video (69.38%),
- the printer (51.98%),
- audio (39,13%),
- laptop (37.62% ). (Epson, 2015).

#### *Figure 5. Use of technology in the US vs the rest of the worlds (TES global, 2015).*

In the study "The Impact of Technology in US Classrooms" conducted by TES Global, the results of their survey conducted on teachers from 26 countries showed the following global impact of classroom technology:

- 96% of teachers in the US think technology plays a significant role in the classroom versus 94% in the rest of the world (ROW).
- Internet connectivity is a bigger challenge for classrooms outside the US; 50% say this is a barrier to tech compared to 35% in the US. Insufficient access to computers and tablets is seen as the biggest barrier in all regions (61% US vs 59% ROW).

 Teachers in the US are more likely to use technology to communicate with parents (78% US vs 54% ROW) and collect and analyse data (15% US vs 12% ROW); however, other countries are more likely to use technology to facilitate blended learning (13% US vs 16% ROW) (AUSTIN, TX, March 10, 2015 http://www.tesglobal.com/).

All teaching aids have the purpose to make lessons easier to learn, more interesting. They are usually chosen by the teacher, in terms being useful to the context of the lesson. The teaching aids also have as objectives to enhance teacher's ability to make the process of teaching-learning more effective, to develop easy and understandable material, to create interest in the taught subject, to increase the attention of students and to communicate better.

#### *The use of audio-visual aids*

These aids are directed at the auditory and/or visual senses, according to the following (figure.6). (Hinst, 1971).

#### *Figure 6. Audiovisual aids (Hinst, 1971).*

The Audio-visual aids are particularly suited for language learning, media studies, music studies, video studies, history studies etc. Of course, this type of teaching aids has advantages and disadvantages as well. Some of the advantages of using audiovisual aids are:

- They help grabbing the attention of students
- It provides a realistic approach to the students
- It helps to make the learning process more effective since it represents information and it makes it more conceptual
- Some of the disadvantages might be caused by technical problems, by lack of space or can be time consuming.

Media is often regarded as an audio-visual aid. Some authors such as De Cecco use the term "media" as a synonym for "audio-visual aids" while De Corte et al., do not. In this paper they are regarded as synonyms. According to recent research, visual materials enhance the learning process. According to Mohanty, the use of visual aids in teaching learning process has multifarious values (Mohanty, 2001), since visual aids give chance to speakers to make a more professional and consistent performance. By visual aids in teaching is one mode to enhance lesson plans and give students additional ways to process subject information (Kunari, 2006). As I also mentioned earlier, the use of audio-visual materials if very effective in language teaching lessons, since the audio-visual resources can help solve certain language barrier problem as they provide accurate visual image and make learning easier for the student (Chacko, 1981).

A study was made in 2015, by Ghulam Shabiralyani et al, published in Journal of Education and Practice, on the impact of visual aids in enhancing the learning process. The results showed high impact, according to the statistics that I will also provide below. The targeted population for their research was the staffs and students of the Ghazi University Campus Dera Ghazi Khan, Indus International Institute Dera Ghazi Khan, Government Degree College Dera Ghazi Khan, Government High School No.1 (Center of Excellence) for boys and girls. The authors used closed ended questionnaires used to measure various parameters which showed the impact of visual aids in enhancing the learning process of the students, and the data was analyzed through the SPSS software using regression and correlation analysis.

Their results in the analysis showed that 70% of the students and teachers agreed that the visual aids help in motivation and only 30% of students and teachers disagreed. (Figure. 7. 8. 9).

*Figure 7. Visual aids help in motivation (Shabiralyani et al, 2015).*

*Figure 8. Increased vocabulary due to visual aids (Shabiralyani et al, 2015).*

According to their collected data 68% of the students and teacher agreed that visual aids increase the vocabulary.

*Figure 9. Saved time due to visual aids (Shabiralyani et al, 2015).*

Their study also showed that the visual aids help in the saving of teachers and students time in preparing of lessons.

The last benefit was avoiding dullness and direct experience, and according to the results of their study, t 71% of the teachers and students agree that visual aids avoid the dullness but 29% disagreed with this statement. Regarding the direct experience, 92% of the teachers and students agreed that through visual aids the direct experience increased to observe the things while 18% disagreed with this statement.( Figure.10. 11).

*Figure 10 . Direct experience due to visual aids (Shabiralyani et al, 2015).*

*Figure 11. Avoid dullness due to visual aids.*

#### *The use of technological teaching aids*

Technological teaching aids are those materials and tools used by teachers in order to deliver a lesson which imply the use of technology, such as computers (for powerpoint presentations), interactive white boards, projectors, online learning platforms and resources, distance learning resources, etc.

An interactive whiteboard (IWB) is a large interactive display in the form factor of a whiteboard. It can either be a standalone touchscreen computer used independently to perform tasks and operations, or a connectable apparatus used as a touchpad to control computers from a projector. The Interactive Whiteboard can be used by teachers in order to present material and receive feedback from students, to direct instruction more effectively or else to carry out formal assessments. For example, a student may both solve a puzzle involving math concepts on the interactive whiteboard and later demonstrate his or her knowledge on a test delivered via the classroom response system Computers have a very large spectrum of use, and they will be covered later in the project. As teaching aids, **PowerPoint** presentations are the most common, since they are good for large rooms and audiences, can include audio-visual materials, charts, diagrams, maps, and other resources.

Smart Boards are also a modern technological teaching aid which is integrated tools in the classrooms and enhancing the whiteboards to be used to conjunct with several projectors and laptops, offering facility to transmit the data from computerbased, multi-media content and so on to the main board at the class in front of all the students.

"Podcasts are a series of digital media files, usually digital, audio, or video, which is made available for download via web." (Czerkawski, 2011)They are useful as teaching aids because via **internet** it allows instant access to resourceful materials and it can even make lessens available online for the students, making the learning process easier since the students can re-listens to important information that they make have skipped or not understood during the class. It is also a useful tool for making projects, since it offers students access to a controlled database of materials and academic resources.

## <span id="page-89-0"></span>**3. E-Books**

"An eBook is a form of publishing in a digital medium and since reading is the basic component of most educational activities, it is necessary to reach all students, especially special need students and distance learning classes." (webopedia.com) It is considered the biggest change in the editing field, since Gutenberg, and it was introduced on the market as a digital document accessible on a computer in 1998.

Digital or electronic material display is the option such as any other material to Speech that can provide learners further modalities information, such as allowing readers to interact with the text by moving the details to be interacted and associated with dictionaries. By using e-books as tools, accessibility can expand and easily used both for instructors and their students.

Many "E-books" are electronic modes of the previous books. Often, they can be read via a free software, such as Adobe Reader, from a desktop computer, a laptop, tablet, phone, e-book reader or Personal Digital Assistant (PDA).

The most used formats used by the "e-book providers are Microsoft Reader, Adobe eBook and Palm Doc," all of them including restricted access and DRM – digital rights management. The new technologies used by Microsoft Reader and Adobe can be used only on a specific hardware on which there is a Microsoft Windows installed. This is also valid for Gemstar or hiebook.

In 1999 there was an initiative created in order to make anormal format for the e-book readers. This initiative was created by eBook Open Forum called "Open eBook publication specification" (OEBPS). The Open eBook is based on XML (eXtensible Markup Language).

In education, e-Books can have various impacts. First of all they can be used as learning aids by the students or as teaching aids by the teachers, for example electronic Manuals. There are many advantages of the digital books, the most important one being the fact that the delivery is instant and they're always available, so they constitute an important resource that can sustain for a long and at any time the learning process.

The content of the digital book is enriched with several and wide multimedia elements, such as sound, video, animations, and in manuals this is an important aspect because all these elements can help the student better understand the content. They can also contain interactive tests, questionnaires, and simulations.

Of course, the e-books are an alternative to the traditional book, but they can also be used as complementary aids in modern teaching strategies and techniques. I will further present the advantages and disadvantages of e-books (Al-Dulaimi, 2017).

The advantages of eBooks are:

 They can be read on various supports, such as laptops, tablets, phones, pda's, so they are more accessible and available to the readers at any time. The reader does not depend on the schedule of a library or a book store.

 The content is enriched with multimedia elements which can benefit the students since the form of delivery of information is more complex and easier to understand.

 Ebooks can contain bookmarks, dictionaries, links to relevant websites or extensions and notes with relevant information required to understand a specific part, a concept, a word, or a reference.

 They can be personalized for students with disabilities by using text to voice options.

 They have reduced costs since there is no need to pay for the print, the paper, cover and so on.

 They have the possibility to include tests, evaluation instruments and tasks for the students

 They can gather the curriculum to discuss with a platforms or groups and combine the curriculum with technology

 Ebooks can assist the process of learning more visual and active for the students and offer immediate access to information and knowledge, whyle saving ours of Internet surfing, library research and book acquisition.

 Digital books can let the students work from distance when are unable to participate physically in the class

- They improve the lecture experience in comparison to the notes taken on paper
- Students can store they tasks collections as an electronic book, by saving physical space and increasing portability.
- The commentaries of the lecturers is easily understanding for the students to diagnose the weak and strong points of their work

The disadvantages of the Ebooks are that even though the multimedia capabilities are not essential for adult readers, in e-learning or distance learning it is important to insert videos, animations or even simulations when complex concepts must be explained and unfortunately at the moment the multimedia functions are limited. Another disadvantage would be the fact that online reading is not as comfortable as the printed book

For the future, teachers could learn how to produce their own teaching materials in electronic format and use them in the classroom, or assigning tasks to the students, creating an interactive environment which would save time both for the students and themselves, since they would not require that much time for printing, making copies of subjects for test papers, and it would provide a more rich experience for the learning-teaching process. Unfortunately, at the moment there are not so many schools and teachers who create their teaching materials in electronic format.

## <span id="page-92-0"></span>**4. Usage of computer teaching software aids**

Lately, necessity to evaluate technology and emergence of the new technologies, there have been several discussions on whether schools should integrate technology as teaching aids and what the role of technology in education is.

The reality is that technology has become a very important part of our lives and it represents a very important tool in the life of students from the new generation

*Figure 12. Statistical analysis of usage of computer teaching aids (Findings from the IEA SITES 2006 Study).*

since their habits are technology-based and the way they think, understand, learn vary depended upon materials such as laptops, ipads, ebook-readers and other types of new technology. I will statistically analysis some on usage of the computerization teaching aids. (Figure 12. 13. 14).

*Figure 13. Statistical analysis of usage of groups of teaching aids and methods (Findings from the IEA SITES 2006 Study).*

*Figure 14. Statistical analysis of educational method (Findings from the IEA SITES 2006 Study).*

"Even if digital curriculum and assessment seem to be mostly applicable in countries at more advanced stages of ICT development, various digital materials are increasingly available for use, and adaptation within developing countries**."** (Czerkawski, 2011)

## <span id="page-94-0"></span>**5. Advantages of using modern technological aids in education and the solving obstacles**

Since the huge impact of technologies in the field

of education and has shaped a new model of teaching. In this new model, there are a series of dimensions of the educational process which can be synthetized as follows:

- a. The educational process has become more interactive and adaptable, flexible, student-oriented. Online education and distance learning offer useful competencies for young adults and the development teaching aids have a positive impact on increasing the efficiency on both the learning and teaching process. The interactive learning and teaching model creates a better communication, a more collaborative learning environment. "Technology in the classroom enables the use of more interactive educational tools, which allows for a dynamic learning experience that directly benefits students." (Wang & Bryan, 2014)
- b. The new systems of virtual educations are based on the development of specialized competences according the approached topic. The development of critical thinking is an essential tools for a new technologies. The user has various means of exposure and presentation of information. Also using multimedia systems indicated a social tendency to develop a new interactive approach to the educational environment regarding means of accessing information and generating content.
- c. As opposed to the traditional learning system which had a linear paradigm, the new modern approach is oriented towards the student, is more collaborative and how the information is delivered and what the priorities and interests of the student are become central for the teachers, whose position also changes and he/ she will require for learning process. The information is no longer transmitted unidirectional, the contemporary learning environment is directed in both.

Technology in education is manifested through the use of computers. Schools have a necessity for a digital resources, such as "electronic grade books, digital portfolios, learning games, and real-time feedback on teacher and student performance, are a few ways that technology can be utilized." (Bidita, 2016)

The advantages of using technology in the educational environment are multiple and I will present them in this section, but there are also many obstacles and barriers in the use of these modern teaching and educational aids. Therefore I will first discuss the barriers and obstacles, and finally the advantages. (Figure, 15).

#### *Obstacles to using technology in education*

*Figure 15. Barriers in using technology in education (The International Society for Technology in Education, 2002a).*

As I mentioned in a previous section, however, technology will not happen overnight, it is a long process that must be sustained. Teacher training in ICT and use of technologies is very important since they are the ones who must troubleshoot if problems or technical issues emerge, also they are the ones who must further pass their knowledge to the students so a first obstacle in this regard would be the fact that teachers must have a time to learn about software and the hardware technology, by which is time consuming and also inefficient and dangerous, since malfunctioning technology can also cause incidents and accidents if not offered rapid maintenance (Cuban et al, 2001).

As I mentioned earlier, if a teacher looks for special technology to overwhelm his/her flightiness from modern technology and "I stress that once more since the training of teachers should be considered a priority in the plan of integrating technology, as do researchers who have found that technology implementation is directly determined by the educational philosophies and pedagogy of the classroom teacher." (Grant et al, 2004.)

Some extra hours would be required for planning and discussing with other teachers in order to establish goals and develop strategies and methods of evaluation of the use of these new aids. "Depending on the geography and the physical coordinates of the learning environment, some countries, cities do not have local training options available so more time is added to attend training." (Harwood and Asal, 2007)

Also, in some countries, the schools might not have enough funds to buy technological aids, computers and so on, and "without computers in the classroom and appropriate software to support the curriculum, integration cannot take place," so as obstacles lack of funding or lack of good leadership is very important. "When principals are unsupportive or uninformed about technology usage in the classroom, students are less likely to utilize any type of digital tools, and so are the teachers." (Markiseme, 2016) Leaders are perhaps not found uninteresting in technology so integration does not receive the proper support, which is why the administration must also be informed and updated with the benefits of using technology sine they are the ones that must make sustained efforts to create educational projects, raise funds and invest in technology.

Another obstacle, which was identified by Zhao, Pugh, Sheldon, and Byers that "is the fact that although schools often have computer labs, teachers might not have easy access to them if they needed to compete with other teachers for laboratory time and even in the library there is limited access, so a good management is also required to overcome the availability barrier. When schools do not take time to create comprehensive technology plans, teachers, students and other school members are confused about how and when to appropriately use technology." (Wise & Hauser, 2007)

One barrier which more than often is ignored is change. The integration of technology is a major paradigm shift, since it changes the educational system and shifts the focus from the objectives of curriculum to the adaption of them to the student's needs and the teacher becomes a facilitator. Also, the traditional teaching tools do not require training, so there are easier to use. Learning how to use new teaching tools can create resistance, because usually change does create resistance. In my opinion, it is very important for teachers to keep an open mind have the interests of their students as priority, being determined to invest in their own professional evolution, in continuous learning and for the old generations of teachers to maintain the interest alive and adapt to new changes.

Rogers' "diffusion of innovation theory" from 1995 that could be explained the process of adapting innovations in the educational environment, such as the use of technology. He is clearly defined the diffusion as "the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. It is a special type of communication, in that the messages are concerned with new ideas," although Rogers also outlines the "five constituent elements of diffusion: relative advantage, observability, compatibility, complexity, and trialability." (Rogers, 1995). The relative advantage questions whether what the innovation replaces was better, why it was or not, if the change is or not worth it and it implies a risk management situation.

The second element is observability and consequences are observed of the innovation process, and if the results are positive, then they will be more likely to adopt the technology according to Rogers. The following element is compatibility and it refers to whether the innovation is consisted with the needs of the potential adopters, with their values.

Complexity refers to whether the innovation is easy to maintain, use and understand, also if the techniques for anticipating potential problems are easy or complicated. "The last element is trialability and it refers to whether the innovation can be tried on a limited basis or not. If teachers are to adopt technology, they must recognize and understand the five elements of diffusion according to Rogers." (Rogers, 1995).

The development and implementation of new technologies generates a paradigm shift in regard to the function of the teachers who becomes a moderator or a facilitator of the learning process, a coordinator of the teaching and learning of those whom he addresses to. The learning paradigm also shifts for the students because he or she is no longer a passive spectator, or a passive receptor who assimilates information and gives no feed-back and the only testing method is the evaluation. The learner finally has something to say about his or her learning process and make his or her own decisions.

Meige notes that in reality, the multimedia and new technologies is generally highly used The contemporary education systems develop the task of a continuous training and the development of specialized competences is an actual problem since the educational curricula directs the teaching process in order to create quality education and training which would result in well-prepared individuals who will be able to adapt in a society with digital characteristics. Recent studies show that teachers actually have the tendency to crave for more access, at least in the US, according to a study conducted in 2015, by TES Global, called The Impact of Technology in US Classrooms. (Figure, 16)

#### *Figure 16. Teachers crave more access to technology (The Impact of Technology in US Classrooms, by TES Global 2015).*

According to their results, "the survey showed that the biggest complaint from teachers is that they do not have enough hardware. More than 60% say they do not

have enough computers/tablets, and affirm that tablets are the most wanted technology in their classroom. WiFi is also a concern; 35% claim that internet connectivity is a barrier to successful use of technology in the classroom. On the software side, teachers were enthusiastic about game-based learning. 20% would like to see more in their classroom, above all other new technology." (Miege, 2003) Some elemental barriers to be used in the classroom depend on technology that is still remain a concerning matter, despite the advantages and benefits which I will further discuss in the section below.

#### *Advantages of using technology in education*

*Figure 17. The advantages of using technology in schools. (The role of electronic equipment in the educational process" by Epson, 3 to 8 June 2015).*

According to the survey results of the study conducted by Epson in 2015, see Figure,17 . "The role of electronic equipment in the educational process, their results showed:

- Increased attention throughout the lesson (66.71%)
- Rapid assimilation of knowledge (64.57%)
- Develop technical skills (61.73%)
- Shorter learning (37.2%)
- Better results at school (31.52%)."

The contemporary education systems have suffered various modifications, by adapting to the requirements of the society with informational character. A large number of young people have enrolled in higher education, policies of human resources have developed based on efficiency and assimilation there have been various fluctuations in the work market and in this context the digital competences have pushed for the emergence of e-learning.

A new type of communication has been developed in the educational area, which started from a basic online medium and presents a series of advantages, such as:

#### a. *Accessibility and interactive utility of information*

Interactive learning presents some advantages in comparison to the classic education, in the sense that multitasking and interdisciplinary guides us to using more efficiently the information, through the use of databases, search engines, websites, forums, virtual communities and others. The interactive utility, which is multitasking presents the advantage of a diverse learning by using more specialized tasks.

#### b. Specialized learning of the tasks

The programs and informational applications present a major impact due to the specialized use according to the specific tasks and the opportunity of the user to work with information from different relevant fields is a challenge characteristic to our society and a current practice for the students.

#### c. Social modelling trough interactive communication

"Interactive communication is the trademark of our society and its forms include basic dialogue and nonverbal communication, interactive fiction and storytelling, hypertext, interactive television and movies, photo and video manipulation, video sharing, video games, social media, user-generated content, interactive marketing and public relations, augmented reality, ambient intelligence, and virtual reality," (CARDOSO, 2008) e-books and others and through interactive communication, pupils and students can opt for distance learning option and either by choosing an online university program or by interacting with participants and visiting various online systems: dedicated forum, virtual networks, specific communities.

d. Increase of the speed of accessing information

Given the fact that the traditional model of education is analyzed experimentally, there are big differences to the new digital systems, so when it comes to online learning it is a new model of knowledge assimilation. The emergence of new educational systems generate a specialized request on the market of this new type of technology. The purpose of the new educational tools is based on developing abilities and specialized competences.

The diverse educational software, which have been previously discussed, ensure the required means for a competitive education, which is characteristic to an informational society. From his perspective, in the e-learning systems students can earn interactively, through this educational modality, complementary to the traditional. The diversity of the programs and applications are very useful in the learning process.

The support activities for the training of teachers are also very useful, the PowerPoint presentations and other types of applications are helpful innovations, like the text processor and the electronic information systems.

Some of the most important benefits of using technologies in the educational environment:

- A More Interactive Experience
- Unlimited Source of Resources
- Necessary Skills and competences for the Future
- Saves Precious Resources
- Instantly Updated Information
- The awareness of the fact the acquired knowledge will find their utility
- The increase of the yield of learning by appreciating the immediate response of teh students
- A higher motivation for the learning process
- Stimulation of imagination and critical thinking
- Introducing a cognitive, efficient style and promoting individual learning and work
- Promoting competitively and self-development
- Mobilization of the psychomotor functions in using the computer
- Developing a visual culture
- Creating practical and useful digital skills
- Permanent feedback
- Fast management of data, calculus, showing results, creating graphs, simulations, table and others
- Ensuring the use of adequate strategies in order to solve various tasks
- Developing critical thinking and promoting individual research
- Promoting permanent learning
- Determining a positive attitude of the students for the use of technology which is in benefit of the society
- Help students with disabilities integrate in the educational process and into the society
- Instant access to required information in order to complete a task
- Learning at the student's own pace
- Ability to learn even though unable to be present in a classroom trough elearning
- Time saving, through the use of modern teaching tools, offering the teachers more time for explanations.
- The ability to make simulations to otherwise unlikely to reproduce phenomena.

## <span id="page-102-0"></span>**6. Technological tools for teachers**

The decision on whether to choose technological tools or classical teaching aids in the classroom belongs entirely to the teachers. So a very important aspect in this regard is teachers' training in technological education and technology, since their knowledge on this matter is highly impacting their preferences and the way they would find meaningful ways of applying technology in their educational plan, lessons, and using it as a teaching aid.

Not all of the teachers are trained to integrate technology. In order for schools to begin to implement their instructional technology, there are four questions that must be answered, and those are what is integrating a technology means, in what context can it be located, "what the barriers to technology integration are and what the stages of technology integration" are.

Morton sustains "that technology integration does not imply just considering the computer as a 'tool' due to the fact that educational planners understand, by implying that computer technology is like any other tool, that there is no need for a special training." (Morton, 1996)

Morton also sustains that "computer as tool" helps the developers of every curriculum to create strategies and methods. Integration does not mean simply using the computer or other technological instruments from time to time, occasionally, it is an entire process that comes in stages and is completed when it is used in a manner that supports and enables the development of curriculum objectives. So technology is integrated when it becomes a vital part in the teaching/learning process.

Jonassen shows that "the educational environment has seven aspects that make learning meaningful and this environment is where the integration of technology takes place." (Jonassen, 1995) So it is more of a construct than a real physical place. These seven aspects identified by Jonassen can also be considered seven aspects of technology applicability in the learning process.

- The educational environment is active, therefore technology can be used as a cognitive tool.
- Constructivism cognitive tool
- Contextualization technology can help create simulations
- Intentionality technology can help with the organization which would help both teachers and students better achieve their goals
- Communicative (conversational) and collaborative technology can develop a better communication system via internet (e-mails, forums, video-conferences, online learning platforms) and can help enlarge the educational community, extending it virtually from the classroom
- Reflective cognitive tool for self- evaluation.

The integration of the informational technology in the process of teachinglearning and evaluation has become lately a priority of the educational policies all over the world, so this is generating a new horizon and a new way of looking at how to practice education. The use of technology facilitates the processes of information presentation and delivery to the student. Multimedia technologies are the most common tools for teachers since they combine image, sound, and voice over, video, animation and simulation, and Hypermedia Technologies, which combine multimedia with hypertext, incorporating all type of data. The types of teaching aids will be further discussed in another section of this chapter. The important consequence of using this new type of teaching aids is that the role of the teacher changes and evolves from the traditional one, the teachers is no longer a transmitter of information, he/she becomes a facilitator of learning by creating an educational environment which allow the student to develop and build his/her own knowledge with the help of technology.

In this regard, technology needs to become an integrated part of this environment, which means it has to be used on a daily basis, it must become part of the learning processes of the student and part of the teaching process of the teacher. It is not sufficient for technology to be complementary, in order to make a real difference it has to become a way of teaching and a way of learning, with its own integrated methods and strategies.

Integration of technology is a long process, it is not something that happens overnight, so it requires sustained efforts, resources and training. According to Sandholtz (1997), "technology integration includes five stages with their own patterns of change and requirements: *entry*, *adoption, adaptation, appropriation, and invention*."

According to Dr. Ruben Puentedura (2012) "technology in the classroom can be incorporated in any range of ways that suit an educator's comfort level. That spectrum was developed in 2012 by him and is summarized with the letters SAMR, which stand for *Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition*, representing four different degrees of technological integration into learning, from slightly supplementing instruction to completely redefining what it means to teach." I will further present the stages of integration, as described by Puentedura and Sandholtz as well.

#### <span id="page-105-0"></span>**6.1. The importance of using technologies as teaching aids.**

Recently there has been a tendency to study shows a gap between students' needs and teachers' capacities "There is an increasing need to recruit many of the tools and techniques of modern educational strategies, to achieve the development of students ' skills in thinking and research, criticism, listening and discipline, to the maximum extent possible."

Which helps a lot in getting the teacher to has his own competency, and trends related to evaluate the depth of study of the students and to see the finest ways to reach their minds and hearts. The educational process has become, in our time, a human long-term project that needs to increase the interest in science and research and internal creativity of the student, also to increase motivation and desire to achieve.

However, the educational trend in many of the existing educational institutions, still depends on the means and methods of indoctrination characteristic to traditional education, which reduce the student's will and involvement, waiting for his turn always to participate, at a time determined by the teacher, and in accordance with what he sees. This may lead to the suppression of his talents, and turn off the creative flame that she/he has.

Researchers have suggested that technology can enhance learning, since technology can improve some skills of the students, such as communication skills, by using word processing programs and communicating via e-mail, or organizational skills and the capacity to better understand science concepts by using modeling software (such as Matlab), "database programs, animations, graphs, spreadsheet programs or by using design and multimedia tools such as presentation software, editing software for digital images and videos." (Honey et al., 2005; Johnston, 2000; Means, 2000).

According to recent literature, "the use of technology has a positive impact on students' academic results concluded that, when integrated appropriately, the introduction of technology in the education program resulted into an interactive relationship based on feedback between the teachers and students" (Guleck et al., 2005). Stratham and Torell (1999) and showed enhanced skills of problem solving and inquiry, therefore higher engagement of the students in the educational program, which led to lower dropout rates.

After the implementation of "Microsoft Corporation's Anytime Anywhere Learning Project, a program that provided students and teachers at 800 schools with laptops for use at school and at home, the evaluations reported that after implementing the technology in the educational program, students were able to direct their own learning and were more involved in the learning program." (Gulek and Demirtas, 2005) Apple also had a similar program, the first of this kind, called Apple Classrooms of Tomorrow (ACOT) through which "they provided one-to-one computer access to students and teachers, from 1985 to 1998 and their evaluations after the implementation of the technology also revealed that students had better communication skills, enhanced problem-solving skills and the students were able to learn independently." (Means, 2000; Weston et al., 2010)

However, studies also indicate that students are not the only ones who might "benefit from the introduction of technology into the teaching methods," since teachers might also benefit from the ability to create course materials and deliver lessons in a more authentic way, providing additional sources of information and delivering the information in a more interactive way (Healey, 2001; Waddoups, 2004). Research indicates the ability of the teacher to integrate technology into the curriculum is very important (Valdez, 2005; Jackson 2004), therefore "each teacher's current level of technological skills should be determined before designing professional development According to Cooley (2001) it is very important to prepare teachers to implement the program of educational technology, since the technology itself cannot do much for the student." (Bonifaz & Zucker, 2004)

#### <span id="page-106-0"></span>**6.2. Computer education and its applications**

I have previously discusses throughout the entire chapter about the use of technology in education. The use of technology in education would not be possible without the use of computers. ICT is the discipline that studies all technological aspects and the use of computers. So I have already mentioned two applications of the computer applications, of course I will not extend upon these two aspects in this section.

There are more applications of computer education in all of the disciplines. For example, in mathematics and physics, chemistry and other sciences computers offer a great environment and tool for calculus, for simulations of complex phenomena, for statistics and animations that can help teachers develop and conduct not only teaching materials, but also their own research, which would otherwise take a much longer time to complete in the absence of this tool.

In arts, such as literature, photography, movie directing the computer has also very important applications in video editing, content editing, online libraries, book editing software, photo editing software and others, online publishing platforms for authors, online libraries and eBooks with instant access to information and great works in literature.

Computers are also important in marketing, journalism and advertising, offering access to the interent and providing marketing tools, social media, and blogs. The programming and informatics areas are obvious fields which benefit the most of the use of computers. Our society is an informational one and individuals are required to have digital competences in almost every field.

In the case of education, computers have created the context of emergence a developed environments, which is the concretization of their application: virtual learning platforms, blended learning, e-learning and distance learning.

Virtual learning platforms have been previously discussed, they include forums, virtual learning communities, and other educational tools. Blended learning and e-learning is the main topic of the following part below.

## <span id="page-107-0"></span>**7. Blended learning**

According to Garisson, the blended learning concept is "a formal education program in which a student learns at least in part through online delivery of content and instruction with some element of student control over time, place, path or pace." (Garisson, 2004). Blended learning is a "combination of learning at a distance and the traditional classroom." The "blended learning" term has begun to be used at the end of the 20th century and one of the older references appears in a press release in 1999 at Interactive Learning Centers and in 2006 the first manual of blended learning appears, written by C.J. Bonk and C.R. Graham who defined the blended learning systems as those systems which "combine the direct interaction between teachers and students with the teaching assisted by computer.

Blended Learning is a modern teaching concept, very flexible, developed with the purpose of offering each student an advanced level of technical knowledge. The system is based on new concepts and teaching methods, being stuent-centered. It promotes both the study assisted by trainer and the individual online study.

In blended learning "students have a fixed schedule where they will have to attend a part of the classes at the educational institution and for the rest, they can make their own schedule, attend the rest of the classes and do their coursework and assignments online." (Pop, 2017)The (table nr.2) below illustrates the strategies, tools and resources for blended learning**.**

*Table 2. Strategies, tools and resources for blended learning.*

In order to transform a classic course in Blended Learning format, it is required for the content to be based on the specificity of each discipline and on the already existing digital materials. In order to create a Blended Learning course Web and Course Authoring instruments are usually used.

An efficient Blended Learning course must be:

- Student centered
- Logically and attractively structured with graphs, tables, schemes, animations, simulations, hyperlinks
- Interactive- it must contain multimedia and auto-evaluation means which can offer feedback regarding the progress of the students and the degree of understanding of the content.

The Course Authoring instruments offer several tools for the creation of content of the courses (HTML, XML, PDF etc.) and allow the integration of multimedia files, such as images, audio and video files, animations, simulations, based on predefined templates and on the possibility of file conversion from various formats (Word, Power Point, Excell, PDF etc.).

The course must be organized in modules and chapters, contain tests and provide feedback with the purpose of visualizing the progress of the students in the learning process, in order to grade the student and generate the reports.

The Web Authoring Instruments offer the next important facilities for the creating and editing of the pages or websites trough predefined templates and styles, HTML pages management, creating page linkages, standardizing the layout of the pages, colors in order to ensure a unitary aspect of the entire website and offering dynamic and interactive pages for students.

Below, I will describe the steps required for the creation of an interactive course, according to Petrescu (2011):

(1) Identification of the objectives of the course

(2) Identification of the number of activities required for achieving the objectives

(3) Establishing of the required time for each activity

(4) Creating the first course, by taking into account the following aspects:

a. Adding interactive resources to the content

i. Adding video resources

ii. Adding slide-shows

iii. Adding feedback resources

iv. Adding questionnaires

b. Adding traditional resources

c. Adding external resources

(5) Creating weekly resources

a. Creating a stream of the lesson which would allow the teacher to control the interaction with the other available resources. Its purpose is to help with organization.

b. Adding a feedback form for each lesson.

(6) Evaluation of the students:

a. By means of a multiple-choice test. Blended Learning Platform enables loading the questions and options for a multiple choice test and also real-time assessment. The teacher must only choose the questions and the rest of the process is automated.

b. By means of a dynamic test. The teacher can ask uploading the solutions for tasks on a platform.

c. By means of the classical test. The teacher can publish dynamic subjects and even receive resolutions, but the correction will be done manually.

d. The publication notes will be made through the catalog.

e. Clarification of the results is via a chat or a forum thread.

(7) Consultations offered by teachers can be made through sessions or through private chat forums.

When properly implemented, "blended learning can result in improved student success, satisfaction, and retention. Data analytics can also identify students who need early intervention, thus increasing retention and the available online tools can also significantly enhance student engagement, ensuring that all students participate in course discussions and benefit from collaborative learning." (Pop, 2017)

## <span id="page-113-0"></span>**8. Education and distance learning**

In the last decades, the electronic communication in the educational environment has become a constant of the last decades. The communication model has created an alternative learning support which marks a transfer of competences from an unidirectional, exclusivist learning model to a multidirectional model of educational communication, in the context of which the teachers has become the facilitator of the learning process for the students and the students has become more involved, no longer being just a passive observer.

The new technologies have put a greater emphasis on the needs and choices of the individual benefiting from the education, it has changed the entire educational system, the teaching methods, the tools, offering greater opportunities for students and for teachers as well to develop professionally, to acquire new competences which have a great importance in our contemporary informational society.

A new educational system in contemporary teaching is represented by elearning, an educational system which has become more and more present in the universities and pre-university environments. The fundamental component of the elearning systems is represent by specialized applications of teaching and evaluation. Online learning has a diverse spectrum of activities. There are many advantages that e-learning brings to the educational practice:

- Allows remote learning system, interactive;
- Generates and enables specific online assessments;

• Learning focuses on specific tasks according to the interest of the student or student's training allows a high degree of adaptability to the requirements of contemporary education systems;

• This type of education develops organizational skills and self-discipline learning time;

• Develops individualized learning practice, according to contemporary educational requirements;

Internet-based education and new media builds an educational model suitable to the needs of the young generation and offers an alternative to traditional education, especially for adults with busy schedules who have a full time job. Interest analysis developed in this study is directed at understanding the relationship existing between the traditional and the modern education.

Depth analysis of issues arising from new media used in education leads us to conclude that the online user has a more diversified leeway when accessing such systems. Compared to a traditional education system, new media has two fundamental characteristics. The first one is interactivity. The user accesses multiple online component, which gives various opportunities in this environment.

Secondly, is the concept of ubiquity. In simplest terms this concept is reduced to the idea of unlimited communication in the digital system. There is a relationship between the education system enforceability traditional and the contemporary type. The two systems complement each other to the benefit of general and specialized, offering a dynamic conclusive postmodern education and training systems.

Online learning platforms, or e-learning, is created to sustain the individual learning process and allow users and students to access a series of informational resources on online environments, allowing them to engage in a series of debates on various themes

"E-learning is not created in order to replace the traditional educational systems, but to act as an aid in the learning / teaching process. It has been adopted by the educational institutions as an alternative to the traditional educational strategies, being complementary to the school activity." (Rosenberg, 2001) This type of platform is designed for active learning, it involves the use of an internet connection and of a computer. For teachers it can be a useful teaching aid and it can help stimulate students to use their spare time more usefully, creating activities specific to each subject or discipline.

E-learning has many benefits, and disadvantages as well. The first benefit is that it can engage a wider audience, since a virtual classroom is not limited to a number of students, the physical limitations being overcome.

"For distance education aimed at the masses, and in particular those excluded from traditional forms of education, e-learning education are likely to remain important for many years to come." (Rosenberg, 2001) since the educational elearning platforms offer studying opportunities for those with a busy schedule, they act as a teaching aid, and they promote active learning and are very accessible. One of the major advantages are that they stimulate interactivity and collaboration, the mobility and geographic independence, the fact that they can engage a higher audience and the individualization of the learning process which is a great benefit for the individual who can learn at his or her own pace and receive feedback.

The key-competences have a more integral, general character than the other curricular arias, however they target permanent education. At the moment there are various discussions related to the content of the curriculum. Education based on competences means emphasizing the methodological side of gaining various knowledge, with a more defined pragmatic aspect than simple education, based on a traditional vector. Competencies have been introduced in Romania during 2001 and 2010. The documents of the European commission are synthetizing the actual stat of the general issue of competences, in an integrating holistic approach. Competences is a term coined by N. Chomsky, with origins in psycholinguistics and psychology, later applied to professional qualifications (especially in the U.K.). The construction of various competences and abilities is approach in teaching by Piaget and D'Hainaut. J. Piaget (1998) connects the development of a competency with an action scheme. Ph. Perrenoud (1998) considers the competency a genetic potentiality of the human spirit ("capacity to act efficiently in a specific situation"), covering the "procedural knowledge" (as "savoire - faire"), by opposition (and complementarity) with the "actual "ones; the author develops an appreciation which underlines the paradigm of implementation of competencies using competencies as targets for education is a very generous fact but it implies very important changes in programs, in the methods of teaching, in the training of the teachers.

Learners in the 21st century live in a technological framework touches every corner of their worlds, and the educational arena is no exception. Educators use technology to facilitate and assess learning, stimulate thinking, expose learners to diverse perspectives on issues, and create community between and among learners and teachers. Technology is a tool that can fascinate teachers and learners alike; however, health professions educators must always keep in mind that it is a means to an end, and not an end in and of itself. Since educational technology – which runs the gamut from a traditional textbook to robotics – can create a spark that stimulates innovation in educators, competencies in the creative and proper usage of technologies to facilitate learning and professional identity formation, as well as to assess learning, are desirable.

The digital competence is based on the fundamental abilities using computers in order to obtain, copy, evaluate, store, produce, present and send information.. By its nature, the digital competency is interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary, offering possibilities of concretization of all scholar areas. It represents a methodologic model for the all areas of the curriculum and also for very wide areas of the social practice. Digital competence also constitutes a part of the permanent learning competency and an obvious methodological dimension of the curriculum in its frame. (Table 2).

*Table 3. Digital competences*

### Teacher Educator Technology Competencies (TETCs) - synthesis

"The Teacher Educator Technology Competencies (TETCs) were developed to support the redesign of teaching in teacher education programs so that ALL teacher educators are prepared to model and integrate technology in their teaching. Teacher candidates who receive consistent and appropriate experiences with technology throughout their teacher education programs will be more prepared to integrate technology into their own classrooms." (Talbert-Johnson & Oberlander, 2004)

Certainly, teacher educators need a certain instruction that may utilize contentspecific technologies to increase teaching and learning process. Therefore, "Curriculum, as well as teacher educators' use of technology for teaching and learning, impacts preservice teachers' use of technology in their practice. Yet, there is no cohesive set of technology competencies to guide teacher educators in teacher preparation programs. This commentary advocates for the need to develop a common set of technology competencies for teacher educators to help guide their work in helping preservice students develop their ability to teach with technology." (Foulger, 2016)

## <span id="page-130-0"></span>**4. Investigating the level of using modern technologies in education**

Our aim is to summarize a study regarding the provision of modern techniques in education and their utilization, originally through exploring additional educational institutions in Iraq such as secondary schools, and then we moved one step further with our research into a relatively comparative research between Iraq and Romania, we frequented a number of Iraqi and Romanian educational institutions, and the research was performed through the submission of questionnaires to instructors, learners as well as the parents. There were reactions from school supervisors, instructors, learners and parents.

**First:** The samples of students consisted were (410) Romanian students, and (600) Iraqi students.

**Second:** the parents' sample consisted of, (100) Romanian parents, and (150) Iraqi parents.

**Third:** the teachers' sample consisted of, (140) Romanian teachers, and (200) Iraqi teachers.

## <span id="page-130-1"></span>**6.Data Collection Methods**

The necessary details and data for this analysis were collected by using two sources: secondary resources, that included sources such as books and periodicals associated with the analysis subject, and the available online data related to the study's subject, questionnaires that were developed by researcher are its primary sources which were the set of questions associated with the main subject of the analysis.

To find out the selected sample's level of acceptance of the tested dimensions, the analysis implemented the Likert measurement which consists of five levels of acceptability (1-5), accordingly, where number 5 means [agree] with a very advanced level, 4 [agree] the fact with an advanced level, 3 [agree] with a medium level, 2 [agree] with a low level, and 1 [agree] with a very low level. The following gradation was implemented by the analysis to classify the research's arithmetic mean of the sample members' answers of the members to the questionnaire items:

(A) the arithmetic mean of 1- 2.33 shows a rather low level of acceptance.

(B) the arithmetic mean of 2.34 - 3.66 shows a rather medium level of acceptance.

(C) the arithmetic mean of 3.67-5 shows a rather high level of acceptance.

## <span id="page-131-0"></span>**7. Method of Statistical analysis s**

To evaluate the quantitative data gathered from the samples responses several figure testes have been used by the application of SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) program. First we have produced illustrative statistics. Then wavelengths, mathematics regular, average, method, distribution, regular difference, standard deviation have been measured. Internal reliability catalog of the study (Alpha-Crombach) has been measured. The Chi-square Analyze has been used on see the connections of the factors. Effect size for the association of factors also measured with Chi-Square Analyze. For the advanced research Factorial research and Regression have been done. Results of the study mostly described in tables, numbers, and digrams.

## <span id="page-131-1"></span>**7.1. Cronbach's Coefficient Alpha Reliability Test**

#### **Data Analysis and Interpretation.**

The scales were created to be used in our research. The scales were designed to be based on the evaluation of the relevant appropriate theoretical and scientific works, which will provide us with some proof of their content's credibility. This part describes the process of selecting the correct samples to be assessed and tested for their stability and credibility of these measurement. In this study, the consistency of those measures were measured by using Cronbach's coefficient alpha which will based on internal consistency of the samples in each and every scale. The Acceptability and unacceptability standards of the Cronbach's Alpha coefficient as shown in table no.(nr. 7).

*Table 7. Acceptable and unacceptable levels of the Cronbachs' Alpha coefficient*

As Nunnally (1978) said, scale's reliability is better preferred at 0.70 or more. Nunnally (1978) added that samples with values less than 0.30 to overall correlation can be omitted to enhance the scale's reliability. As a result to this study the Cronbach's coefficient alpha value for scales may vary in values according to the data analysis. This research, will compute Cronbach's coefficient alpha for the measures before data screen, and also after data screen,

The degree of availability of teaching techniques at secondary schools in Iraq and Romania did showed some differences, in Romania it was medium and in Iraq it was low, and showed There is a relationship between degree of availability of teaching techniques secondary schools and degree of usage of teaching techniques secondary schools in Iraq and Romania.

## <span id="page-170-0"></span>**8. Conclusion.**

The analysis revealed various differences between the 2 countries, which appaears to be normal, given the different cultures. There are areas in which similarities have also been found, for example :

Iraq and Romanian sample: Study results showed that there is no statistically significant differences in relation to teachers usage of information technology at secondary schools due to gender variable and experience. While the results showed significant differences in teachers usage of information technology because of the variables of age, where the older the teacher the greater the use was less.

### **- the level of degree of availability of teaching techniques at your secondary schools.**

The teachers' sample results show the educational skills at secondary schools in Romania, where "power point" came as the highest in terms of degree of use, and the sample of teachers to practice the degree of usage of the techniques of education at secondary school in Iraq, "computer education and applications" came in a higher place, while the least was "distance learning", indicating that the level of usage of educational technology at secondary schools in Iraq came with a Low degree This indicates a difference between the level of use of teaching techniques at secondary schools in Romania and Iraq.

## - **the level of degree of used of teaching techniques at secondary schools in Romania and Iraq.**

that the arithmetic means for the sample's (-Teachers) approval of practicing the degree of usage of teaching techniques at your secondary schools in Romania ranged (2.16-3.87) the highest was item No. (9), which reads: "PowerPoint ", while the lowest was item No. 5, which reads:" satellite channels educational "; the overall average for the area as a whole was (2.93) by a medium assessment degree, which shows that the level of degree of usage of teaching techniques at your secondary schools in Romania.

that the arithmetic means for the sample's (-Teachers) approval of practicing the degree of usage of teaching techniques at your secondary schools in Iraq ranged (1.33-2.00) the highest was item No. (1), which reads: "Computer education and its applications ", while the lowest was item No. 2, which reads:" Education and distance learning "; the overall average for the area as a whole was (1.62) by a Low assessment degree, which shows that the level of degree of usage of teaching techniques at your secondary schools in Iraq.

This indicates a difference between level of degree of usage of teaching techniques at your secondary schools in Romania and Iraq.

## **- the factors which help in the use of educational techniques in secondary schools.**

The factors that assist in the use of educational techniques at secondary schools in Romania are physical facilities for the presentation of the educational medium "eg, electrical connections, proper lighting, and overhead projectors", the least of which is: "The appropriateness of educational techniques for the physical environment In the classroom that encourages the use of educational techniques, "indicating that the level of factors that assist in the use of educational techniques at secondary schools in Romania came with medium statues. .

It has been shown that the factors that help in the use of educational techniques at secondary schools in Iraq, were: "The appropriateness of educational methods of the physical environment in the classroom, which encourages the use of educational techniques" as the highest, while the least is: "Most of the teaching methods used in Teaching is attractive to students, "indicating that the level of factors that assist in the use of educational techniques in secondary schools in Iraq came with a medium degree of importance, which shows that there is a convergence of the factors that help in the use of educational techniques at secondary schools.

## - **the difficulties facing the use of educational techniques in secondary schools.**

The results show that the difficulties facing the use of educational techniques at secondary schools in Romania are like: "the lack of a timetable for the use of educational materials and materials by teachers of the same educational materials" that came in the with highest importance, while: "It is difficult not to organize conservation Educational material and teaching aids" came as the least important, indicating that the level of difficulties encountered in the use of educational techniques at secondary schools in Romania came to be of a medium degree. While the difficulties faced by during use of educational techniques at secondary schools in Iraq, are like "the degree of difficulty to keep a record of the types of educational techniques that you use normally" came at the highest place, while the least important was : "It is difficult not to know the educational means available within the school". This means that the difficulties faced during the use of educational methods at secondary schools in Iraq came with medium level of importance, indicating that there is a convergence of the degree of difficulties in the use of educational methods at secondary schools.

## - **the level organization and clarity of the language of the textbook and the method of presentation of the curriculum in it.**

The results showed that the level of organization and clarity in the textbook language and presentation method in the Romania context, "The images or forms used closely related to the text," came as the highest important of them, while the least was: "takes into account the element of excitement in the presentation," and this shows that it came With an average rating in Romania. .

While the level of organization and clarity in the textbook's language and presentation method in the Iraqi context, "Presentation style varies depending on the subject presented" as the most important ,while the least was: "There are clear forms, graphs and maps," indicating the level of regulation, and clarity in the language of the textbook and the method of presentation of the curriculum in Iraq came with a medium degree of importance.

#### - **the extent of organization of the curriculum.**

The extent of the organization of the curriculum in Iraq and Romania has reached a medium degree of importance in both of the two countries.

#### - **the role of the curriculum in the use of educational techniques.**

While the role of curriculum in the use of educational techniques in Romania, "The curriculum contains instructions on how to use the teaching method" came as the most important, while the least was: "The quotas allocated to subjects sufficient to use educational techniques according to the curriculum" Which means that the role of curricula in the use of educational technology in Romania came with a medium degree of importance. .

And the role of curricula in the use of educational technology in Iraq, the most

important of them is: the curriculum is on the behavioral goals, "while the least was: " The curriculum contains instructions on how to use the teaching method" which demonstrates that the role of curricula in the use of educational techniques in Iraq Came to a of medium importance degree.

In both countries slight standard deviations of role of the curriculum in the use of educational techniques have been found. However, the degree of availability of teaching techniques at secondary schools in Iraq and Romania did showed some differences, in Romania it was medium and in Iraq it was low, It is important to find meaningful ways and bring change that would shape the learning system into an efficient but also creative one, captivating. I believe educational technology can open big opportunities, for students, teachers and schools as well. I strongly hope more research will be conducted on the benefits of educational technology improvements and the good impact they have on the educational system, regardless of the country they are in.

This analysis can therefore serve as an instrument for further research.

# <span id="page-174-0"></span>**CHAPTER V: THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS OF THE STUDY FOR IRAQ IN EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY COMPETENCY**

## <span id="page-174-1"></span>**PART I**

The results of the study showed that the Iraqi educational is facing some major challenges, and they are like:

- 1. School buildings
- 2. Curriculum and education technology competency
- 3. Teachers
- 4. Teaching methods
- 5. Educational technology, means, and educational activities
- 6. Examinations, and methods of measurement and evaluation
- 7. Educational supervision and adequacy

#### **First: The main issues and challenges facing the educational system**

 The educational sector, which has been deficient in the planning of studied scientific negative practices led to the emergence of major issues and challenges in the reconstruction and modernization of the educational system, the most prominent of which is

## <span id="page-174-2"></span>**1. School buildings**

 An important aspect of the success of the education process is the provision of adequate school buildings, maintenance and sustainability. The problem is that there is an increasing shortage in the supply of school buildings, which caused the inability to absorb the raise in the registered number. And was shown as an increase in its number of schools operating a two-time system .Many schools still do not have the minimum number of physical educational facilities that facilitate the use of educational technologies.

 The improvement in educational services requires efforts not usually to rebuild. The shortage in the school buildings reached (4269) school buildings in 2004, and this number is increasing due to the new opening in the areas of education that were previously deprived.

From the above, the problem of school buildings can be summed up by the following points

Lack of validity of most of the school buildings for educational use, which lose the school environment educational conditions to contain the student and teacher at the same time.

The severe shortage of school buildings, which can not be found in areas where students can easily attend High student density in schools where double use rate (double and triple), which negatively affects the school atmosphere and rationalize its practice

## <span id="page-175-0"></span>**2. Curricula and education technology competency**

 One of the most important challenges faced by the educational sector, which should be addressed in relation to educational curricula and its stalemate, as well as the lack of harmony and compatibility and adaptation to the labor market requirements and its focus on traditional teaching methods and indoctrination without deep understanding. In order to meet these challenges, the Ministry of Education has adopted new directions for educational policy aimed at improving the type of education which helps a lot in keeping up with the rest of the world and the developments in its education and improve the capacity of educational and teaching staff and their competencies to achieve a better response to the working force needs of sustainable development. Basic to raise the quality of education. Therefore, the Ministry of Education should adopt a number of principles in reviewing the curriculum and updating it as the educational reform process, that should be based on an objective study and a comprehensive study of educational environment, and educational system's problems and the obstacles in the way of the process of its reforming and reconstructing, the educational system's responsibility should extended beyond the scope The Ministry of Education and its institutions to ensure the participation of the spectrum of Iraqi society as a whole in the process of change, and all special decisions to reform the curricula must be purely Iraqi and consistent with the values and heritage of Iraqis.

 The curriculum's reform and development requires revision of the curricula and their vocabulary in order to modernize and reorient them to better answer learners' requirements of national development, as well as to keep pace with the level of countries with high performance in the field of education as the curricula used for many attempts to review and improve in order to lead To real development in the curriculum objectives or content or methods.

## <span id="page-176-0"></span>**3. Teachers**

 The Iraqi teacher suffers an extreme neglect and after that, scientific and technical development, and his inability to keep pace with modern technological methods and commensurate with educational objectives and policies, which led to poor effectiveness and continuity with students either in delivering the course material or in activating its role in keeping up with The educational process, as well as the weak link with students and their parents in order to form a coherent and successful educational family, so the conditions of the educational body did not need to consider, both in terms of technical level or performance and the level of professional preparation for teachers.

 That's why a close look at the rehabilitation of the teacher on modern methods and training him in the use of computer and modern techniques and teaching methods in the modern era, in order to increase his skills and upgrading his level using modern techniques of equipment, laboratories and other equipment and advancement, and to promote it to the required level to the success of the educational process with the development of new programs for the coming years to develop the capacity of teachers and their abilities and awareness. The government should also pay a special attention to the process of improving the living standards of teachers by increasing their salaries to match the current market prices, which will positively be reflected on their performance.

## <span id="page-177-0"></span>**4. Selection of teaching methods**

Methods of teaching will be chosen and identified, methods and strategies appropriate for each subject of the article shall be determined. Such methods, methods and strategies shall be relevant to the content, their harmony with the objectives, their motivation for the learners' motivation, and the opportunity for the learner to participate positively in learning, Critical and problem-solving skills, and should be flexible, so that they can be developed or modified, depending on the conditions of the learning environment.

## <span id="page-177-1"></span>**6. Educational techniques, means, and educational activities**

The Educational process requires the a better way in handling the different tools and techniques of education that help both teachers and learners to achieve the objectives of the curriculum. It may introduce new topics on the curriculum that require the use of new images, films, recordings, CDs or cards to facilitate their learning and learning. The necessary technical devices for some educational materials are provided in the hands of learners, teachers and educational supervisors who participate in the application, follow-up and evaluation of the curriculum.

On the basis of the choice of class and non-classroom activities are selected that enhance learning and strengthen learning, enrich experience, help to modify behavior, acquire positive attitudes, satisfy needs, develop trends and hobbies. And to take into account the principle of individual differences, and provide opportunities to help acquire positive values and trends, and educational skills consistent with the nature of the age, especially self-learning skills, and dealing with the technology of education.

## <span id="page-177-2"></span>**7. Exams and methods of measurement and evaluation**

 The exams play an important role in understanding the learner's understanding of the main educational issues and their scholastic achievement through the academic years he / she goes through. It is also the means used to assess the learner's abilities to determine the success of the educational process.

 The school exams in Iraq suffered from the use of old methods and methods in the process of evaluating the student to prevent repetition and dropout due to the lack of specialists in the development of studies necessary to know how to measure and evaluate the learner and the extent of his/her absorption of the subject of the study and evaluation where there are still difficulties in follow-up student and trainee trainee during school years.

 That's why the total educational policy should adopt a new approach in the development of methods of measuring the academic achievement of the student in the course of its plan in the coming years and try to develop modern scientific means to help the teacher to know the extent of excellence in delivering the article to the learner's mind correctly and to indicate the extent of success.

## <span id="page-178-0"></span>**7. Educational supervision and adequacy**

 The deterioration of the educational process in Iraq for the past years included all educational axes, including educational supervision, where the educational supervision in previous years suffered from weakness in guidance, training, evaluation, inertia and neglect, as well as weak role in the educational process, and the role of educational supervisor Is to evaluate the effectiveness of the teacher, but this did not help to mobilize the teacher in the process of education, because of the poor qualification of the educational supervisor and lack of modern educational foundations in the follow-up teacher, and the lack of interaction with the teacher educational supervisor helped the weakness of the educational supervisor, that's why the related authorities should establish a new foundations in improving the role of educational supervisor and attention to be more interactive, and through training in accordance with modern methods to raise its capabilities.

## <span id="page-179-0"></span>**8. Recommendations**

 The Ministry of Education attaches great importance to the events of qualitative changes in the educational system with all its components, inputs, processes and outputs, through concerted efforts and wide community participation in planning, implementation and evaluation, and providing appropriate and rapid support from the world's friendly countries and international organizations and organizations. An educational strategy has been prepared and formulated for the next five years and the directions of its implementation are determined through:

- Re-examine the curriculum in its broad sense to determine the actual needs of society, and re-formulation of educational philosophy and educational goals according to specific timetables and stages**.**
- Benefit from the experiences of other countries in the field of education through openness to it, especially donor countries and advanced, as well as closer cooperation with organizations concerned with education at the international and regional levels**.**
- Developing more educational research and carrying out research and studies in various fields under the supervision of specialized researchers through more attention to research and educational institutions**.**
- Achieve the principle of equal educational opportunities by reducing the gap between the education of boys and girls and provide more educational opportunities for girls and rural areas and the children of immigrants and displaced.

## <span id="page-181-0"></span>**PART II**

## <span id="page-181-1"></span>**1. challenges of traditional education in Iraq- solutions**

#### **First: Related to students**.

- The repeated and unexplained absence of students and the dropouts because of the students' sense of boredom caused by the traditional methods of teaching.

- The weak students' abilities such as seeing and hearing, keeping in mind the different individual abilities of students.

- The varieties of students levels of understanding.

- The students' lack of attention during classes which will cause the wastage of

information and efforts on the teachers' side.

#### **Second: Curriculum's challenges**

- the fact that curriculum sometimes will be outdated and behind the rest of the world.

- Curriculums may too long and cannot be completed in one academic year
- A weak application part as compared to the theoretical part .

#### **Third: organization and school administration**

- Classes overcrowding (large classes).

- Insufficient class-time which is too short for the curriculum.
- The wasted time issue.

.The previously mentioned issues are only some of the isuess that might easily affect the curriculum and keeping in mind that such a wide variety of curriculum issues can only be eliminated with the use of modern technologies in enhancing the curriculum, some of these solutions are:

## <span id="page-181-2"></span>**2. Suggested solutions for Educational Technologies:**

#### **First: based on students themselves.**

- Students' absence: with the e-school the issue of student absence from school can be fixed simply because students can get all of their lessons by emails. .

- the only point of weakness with this method is that students will experience a sort of weaknesses in the development of their audiovisual skills,

that are stimulating, attractive, practical and fast. .

- Students varaitions according to the level of their comprehension: e-learning

eliminates those variations by simply giving the student the space of time that they need, by repeating the lesson to those who need it and to give an extra work to those who need It. .

- Students' use of modern technologies is very developed nowadays simply because their exessive use and sometimes on a daily basis, this can be used in attracting students' attention to the class.

#### **Second: Curriculum related issues .**

.

The curriculum itself is a very sativa thing, introducing the learners with the modern technologies will open a vast space of a continuously developing knowledge that connects the learners with the rest of the world and eliminating the wide educational gaps.

#### **Third: classes organization and school administration .**

- **Large classes**: Introducing the modern technologies in education will help in solving such a problem, simply the large number of students will not be an issue if they all have an access to computers and internet, the teacher's role will be minimized and all of the learners will have access to the targeted knowledge. .

- **Time lack for the curriculum**: Such an issue can be easily treated with the moden technologies, simply because student will have all day access to the lessons on their portal.

## <span id="page-182-0"></span>**3. The technology's importance in modern education**

Nowadays modern technologies play an important role in facilitating the different educational activities, giving modern technologies a primary role in the process of modern education.

• With the rising number of daily use hours, now days most of the young generation are very strongly attached to the use of their electronic devices and such devices are playing a guiding role in the process of education.

• Internet has an important role in an e-classroom by opening a new horizons for the learners.

• Technology has opened a very wide space for daily communication between the learners and their teachers.

## <span id="page-183-0"></span>**4. Steps to apply education technology**

The application of educational technology is as follows.

**First**: Determining the educational technique or educational subject to be addressed. **Second**: Determining the objectives behind the subject.

**Third**: Choosing the right technology .

**Fourth**: Designing the educational environment .

**Fifth:** Implementation .

**Sixth**: the evaluation stage that determines the validity of the used technology, its weaknesses, and the strengths. .

Conclusion: Educational technology doesn't only refer to the use of modern technologies in education such as the smart board and online teaching portals, but also the good use and command over the simple classroom materials, such as chalk and blackboard, and making the full use of them.

#### **Suggested Recommendations and solutions**

Based on our previously mentioned findings, a number of recommendations should be made:

1) The need to hold training courses for members of the teaching staff in general education using up to date technologies and employing such technologies alongside with its use for teaching purposes. .

2) It is necessary to introduce modern techniques in public schools by keeping with the development of curricula. The development of curricula must be accompanied by the development of the techniques used in education.

3) The need to conduct research on the difficulties that impede the use of educational techniques in Iraq's public education.

4) Conducting training workshops on a regular basis, so that every three months, for example, students will learn about the importance of using modern technologies in education to encourage these learners to take part in an educational process and to activate their part in it.

5) The need to provide the necessary educational softwares and other materials to be used in the process of teaching the students' curricula. .

6) Conducting more research activity in the field of e-learning on a continuous basis to keep the teachers informed regarding technology in the education process.

7) Advocacy to make ICT an essential tool in the educational process at all levels, in addition to provide the infrastructure for this technology in schools such as computers, laboratories, communication networks, and so on.

## <span id="page-184-0"></span>**6. Some educational techniques - icons - symbols for used in classrooms in secondary schools:**

#### <span id="page-184-1"></span>*6.1. Computer Education and its Applications*

Information and communication technology is increasingly used for educational purposes by the means of presentation, storage and processing of information. This technology is particularly valuable in the process of teaching children. Education in the perspective of new technologies has opened new directions and orientations in the educational-educational process. It is necessary for the traditional education system to fill its forms and means of intervention in accordance with the current economic and social requirements. The advantage of new technologies is the high receptivity of young people, consumers of new media.

#### <span id="page-185-0"></span>*6.2. Education and Distance Learning*

Distance learning involves the use of a wide range of educational resources and technologies: study materials printed or inserted on CD / DVD or other external memories. In addition, students learn at their own pace, in the place and time they choose. The place of learning is freely chosen (at work or at home). At the same time, they have access to the library; have meetings with teachers (usually once a month, on Saturdays and Sundays). The most important features of distance learning that need to be taught are flexibility and independent learning / self-learning Another alternative available to free students over the weekend is low-frequency education. This is characterized by weekly activities dedicated to the application and synthesis preparation that are compulsory in the curricula, which also require the direct meeting of the students with the teaching staff.

#### <span id="page-186-0"></span>*6.3. Global Information Network Online*

The internet is indispensable. Children are asked to use it to do their school projects. The Internet is useful if we know how to use it properly. Otherwise, it becomes dangerous. The new challenge in education is andragogy, that is, the teacher becomes a facilitator who promotes and lets students discover by experience the truths that they must reach. When doing so, students understand things and start to assume them.

#### <span id="page-187-0"></span>*6.4. Multimedia in Education*

The contemporary evolution of society increasingly involves the use of computers and new technologies in almost all fields. In this respect, today's teacher is "forced" to find new opportunities for the teaching-learning process to be attractive for both students and teachers. Educational multimedia offers pupils and teachers solutions to achieve a gaming-based interaction, animations, logic exercises that can also increase the objectivity of the evaluation.

#### <span id="page-188-0"></span>*6.5. Satellite Channels Educational*

Satellite educational channels are useful in distance education due to its functions and characteristics in delivery, presentation and control characteristics. The approach of educational channels is the same as in distance learning, amplified by sound and visual aids. Children programs are a valid example. Satellite educational channels are also valuable in teaching foreign languages and using multiple technological tools.

#### <span id="page-189-0"></span>*6.6. E-Book*

According to Al-Dulaimi "E-books and mobile devices have quickly grown in popularity. E-books become mainstream and percentage of study materials available as e-books is growing very rapidly. Today, the online learning environment is a popular alternative for those without the time or desire to sit in a traditional classroom for hours on end. Now, the increased availability of e-books (short for electronic books) has made online study even more convenient and affordable"(Al-dulaimi, 2017).

#### <span id="page-190-0"></span>*6.7. The Electronic Board*

Interactive whiteboard or "smart board" is a powerful tool for a modern and interactive education, for sessions, presentations, or training sessions, transforming any space into an attractive auditorium. The fact that students assimilate information taught much more easily by using interactive methods is no longer a secret. Digital education is already present in education and more and more educational institutions choose to equip classrooms with interactive learning equipment

#### <span id="page-191-0"></span>*6.8. Smart Classrooms*

The Smart classroom is based on the integration of multiple technological tools in the classroom, such as interactive whiteboard, computers, PowerPoint presentation, E-Board, Smart TV and tablets. Applications that teach students in the three cities where SmartClassrooms are located do not replace 100% textbooks, but it certainly simplifies matter, and students become more creative and communicating.

#### <span id="page-192-0"></span>*6.9.PowerPoint Data Show*

PowerPoint presentations have come to be the order of the day on any matter. A great emphasis is placed on students' skills to present their ideas in a more attractive way, making them useful later. In vain you have brilliant ideas if you cannot convey them to others! It is in the interest of the children to learn how to make exciting presentations as early as possible.

#### <span id="page-193-0"></span>*6.10. Scientific laboratories*

Scientific laboratories are very important in the study of science and its applications. Without scientific laboratories students cannot understand fully the concepts and cannot develop scientific practical skills. It is important for any school to have scientific laboratories.
